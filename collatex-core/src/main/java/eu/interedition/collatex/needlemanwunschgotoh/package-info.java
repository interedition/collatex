/**
 * A version of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with floating point scoring.
 *
 * This <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm">algorithm</a>
 * strives for global alignment of witnesses and bases the alignment on a
 * configurable scoring of matches vs. differences/gaps.  It does not try to
 * detect transpositions.
