        <witness id="1859">WHEN we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and
            animals, one of the first points which strikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other, than do the
            individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and
            animals which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and
            treatment, I think we are driven to conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic productions
            having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those to which the
            parent-species have been exposed under nature. There is, also, I think, some probability in the view propounded by
            Andrew Knight, that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food. It seems pretty clear that organic
            beings must be exposed during several generations to the new conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of
            variation; and that when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues to vary for many generations.
            No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as
            wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or

        <witness id="1869"> As far as I am able to judge, after long attending to the subject, the conditions of life appear to act
            in two ways, — directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone, and indirectly by affecting the
            reproductive system. With respect to the direct action, we must bear in mind that in every case, as Professor Weismann
            has lately insisted, and as I have incidentally shown in my work on 'Variation under Domestication,' there are two
            factors: namely, the nature of the organism, and the nature of the conditions. The former seems to be much the more
            important; for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under, as far as we can judge, dissimilar conditions; and, on
            the other hand, dissimilar variations under conditions which appear to be nearly uniform. The effects on the offspring
            are either definite or indefinite. They may be considered as definite when all or nearly all the offspring of
            individuals exposed to certain conditions during several generations are modified in the same manner. It is extremely
            difficult to come to any conclusion in regard to the extent of the changes which have been thus definitely induced.
            There can, however, be little doubt about many slight changes, — such as size from the amount of food, colour from the
            nature of the food, thickness of the skin and hair from climate, &amp;C. Each of the endless variations which we see
            in the plumage of our fowls must have had some efficient cause; and if the same cause were to act uniformly during a
            long series of generations on many individuals, all probably would be modified in the same manner. Such facts as the
            complex and extraordinary out-growths which invariably follow from the insertion of a minute drop of poison by a
            gall-producing insect, show us what singular modifications might result in the case of plants from a chemical change in
            the nature of the sap. </witness>

            inheritance from either parent or from some more remote ancestor. Even strongly-marked differences occasionally appear

            millions of individuals reared in the same country and fed on nearly the same food, deviations of structure so strongly
            pronounced as to deserve to be called monstrosities arise; but monstrosities cannot be separated by any distinct line
            from slighter variations. All such changes of structure, whether extremely slight or strongly marked, which appear

        <witness id="1859"> It has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability, whatever they may be, generally
            act; whether during the early or late period of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception. Geoffroy St.
            Hilaire's experiments show that unnatural treatment of the embryo causes monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be
            separated by any clear line of distinction from mere variations. But I am strongly inclined to suspect that the most
            frequent cause of variability may be attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior
            to the act of conception. Several reasons make me believe in this; but the chief one is the remarkable effect which
            confinement or cultivation has on the functions of the reproductive system; this system appearing to be far more
            susceptible than any other part of the organisation, to the action of any change in the conditions of life. Nothing is
            more easy than to tame an animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even
            in the many cases when the male and female unite. How many animals there are which will not breed, though living long
            under not very close confinement in their native country! This is generally attributed to vitiated instincts; but how
            many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! In some few such cases it has been found
            out that very trifling changes, such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth, will determine
            whether or not the plant sets a seed. I cannot here enter on the copious details which I have collected on this curious
            subject; but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, I may just
            mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, with the
            exception of the plantigrades or bear family; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest exceptions, hardly ever lay
            fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless, in the same exact condition as in the most sterile
            hybrids. When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, yet breeding quite
            freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature,
            perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive
            system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting, we need not be surprised at this system, when
            it does act under confinement, acting not quite regularly, and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents or

        <witness id="1869"> With respect to what I have called the indirect action of changed conditions, namely, through the
            reproductive system being affected, we may infer that variability is thus induced, partly from the fact of this system
            being extremely sensitive to any change in the conditions, and partly from the similarity, as Kölreuter and others have
            remarked, between the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct species, and that which may be observed
            with all plants and animals when reared under new or unnatural conditions. Many facts clearly show how eminently
            susceptible the reproductive system is to very slight changes in the surrounding conditions. Nothing is more easy than
            to tame an animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even when the male
            and female unite. How many animals there are which will not breed, though kept in an almost free state in their native
            country! This is generally, but erroneously, attributed to vitiated instincts. Many cultivated plants display the utmost
            vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! In some few cases it has been discovered that a very trifling change, such as a
            little more or less water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether or not a plant will produce seeds.
            I cannot here give the details which I have collected and elsewhere published on this curious subject; but to show how
            singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, I may mention that carnivorous
            animals, even from the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, with the exception of the
            plantigrades or bear family, which seldom produce young; whereas carnivorous birds, with the rarest exceptions, hardly
            ever lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless, in the same condition as in the most sterile
            hybrids. When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, yet breeding
            freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature,
            perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive
            system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail to act, we need not be surprised at this system, when it
            does act under confinement, acting irregularly, and producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents. I may add, that
            as some organisms breed freely under the most unnatural conditions (for instance, rabbits and ferrets kept in hutches),
            showing that their reproductive organs are not affected; so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or
            cultivation, and vary very slightly — perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature. </witness>
        <witness id="1872"> With respect to what I have called the in direct action of changed conditions, namely, through the
            reproductive system being affected, we may infer that variability is thus induced, partly from the fact of this system
            being extremely sensitive to any change in the conditions, and partly from the similarity, as Kölreuter and others have
            remarked, between the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct species, and that which may be observed
            with plants and animals when reared under new or unnatural conditions. Many facts clearly show how eminently susceptible
            the reproductive system is to very slight changes in the surrounding conditions. Nothing is more easy than to tame an
            animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even when the male and female
            unite. How many animals there are which will not breed, though kept in an almost free state in their native country!

        <witness id="1859"> Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists —
            namely, that our domestic varieties, when run wild, gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal
            stocks. Hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature. I
            have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made.
            There would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly-marked
            domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state. In many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was,
            and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued. It would be quite necessary, in order to
            prevent the effects of intercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home. Nevertheless,
            as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me not
            improbable, that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many generations, the several races,
            for instance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil (in which case, however, some effect would have to be attributed to the
            direct action of the poor soil), that they would to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild aboriginal stock.
            Whether or not the experiment would succeed, is not of great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment
            itself the conditions of life are changed. If it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency
            to reversion, — that is, to lose their acquired characters, whilst kept under unchanged conditions, and whilst kept in a
            considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations of structure, in
            such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species. But there is not a shadow
            of evidence in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed our cart and race-horses, long and short-horned
            cattle, and poultry of various breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an almost infinite number of generations, would be
            opposed to all experience. I may add, that when under nature the conditions of life do change, variations and reversions
            of character probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter be explained, will determine how far the new
            characters thus arising shall be preserved. </witness>

            prevent the effects of intercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home. Nevertheless,
            as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me not
            improbable, that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many generations, the several races,
            for instance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil (in which case, however, some effect would have to be attributed to the
            direct action of the poor soil), that they would to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild aboriginal stock.
            Whether or not the experiment would succeed, is not of great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment
            itself the conditions of life are changed. If it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency

            considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations in their
            structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species. But there is
            not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed our cart and race-horses, long and
            short-horned cattle, and poultry of various breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an almost infinite number of
            generations, would be opposed to all experience. I may add, that when under nature the conditions of life do change,

            facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth, on the habits, voice, constitution, and structure of the humped Indian cattle, it
            is almost certain that they are descended from a different aboriginal stock from our European cattle; and some competent
            judges believe that these latter have had two or three wild progenitors, — whether or not these deserve to be called
            species. This conclusion, as well as that of the specific distinction between the humped and common cattle, may, indeed,
            be looked upon as established by the admirable researches of Professor Rütimeyer. With respect to horses, from reasons
            which I cannot here give, I am doubtfully inclined to believe, in opposition to several authors, that all the races
            belong to the same species. Having kept nearly all the English breeds of the fowl alive, having bred and crossed them,
            and examined their skeletons, it appears to me almost certain that all are the descendants of the wild Indian fowl,
            Gallus bankiva; and this is the conclusion of Mr. Blyth, and of others who have studied this bird in India. In regard to
            ducks and rabbits, some breeds of which differ much from each other, the evidence is clear that they are all descended
            from the common wild duck and rabbit. </witness>

            carried to an absurd extreme by some authors. They believe that every race which breeds true, let the distinctive
            characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype. At this rate there must have existed at least a score of
            species of wild cattle, as many sheep, and several goats in Europe alone, and several even within Great Britain. One
            author believes that there formerly existed in Great Britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it! When we bear
            in mind that Britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal, and France but few distinct from those of Germany and
            conversely, and so with Hungary, Spain, &amp;c., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds
            of cattle, sheep, &amp;c., we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in Europe; for whence could they
            have been derived, as these several countries do not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parent-stocks? So
            it is in India. Even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world, which I fully admit have probably descended
            from several wild species, I cannot doubt that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation. Who can believe
            that animals closely resembling the Italian greyhound, the bloodhound, the bull-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, &amp;c. —
            so unlike all wild Canidæ — ever existed freely in a state of nature? It has often been loosely said that all our races
            of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species; but by crossing we can get only forms in some
            degree intermediate between their parents; and if we account for our several domestic races by this process, we must
            admit the former existence of the most extreme forms, as the Italian greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, &amp;c., in
            the wild state. Moreover, the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated. There can
            be no doubt that a race may be modified by occasional crosses, if aided by the careful selection of those individual
            mongrels, which present any desired character; but that a race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two
            extremely different races or speceies, I can hardly believe. Sir J. Sebright expressly experimentised for this object,
            and failed. The offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I have found with
            pigeons) extremely uniform, and everything seems simple enough; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for
            several generations, hardly two of them will be alike, and then the extreme difficulty, or rather utter hopelessness, of
            the task becomes apparent. Certainly, a breed intermediate between two very distinct breeds could not be got without
            extreme care and long-continued selection; nor can I find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thus

            singularly short tails. The barb is allied to the carrier, but, instead of a very long beak, has a very short and very

            The pouter has a much elongated body, wings, and legs; and its enormously developed crop, which it glories in inflating,

            feathers down the breast; and it has the habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the œsophagus. The
            Jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood; and it has, proportionally
            to its size, much elongated wing and tail feathers. The trumpeter and laugher, as their names express, utter a very
            different coo from the other breeds. The fantail has thirty or even forty tail-feathers, instead of twelve or fourteen —
            the normal number in all members of the great pigeon family; and these feathers are kept expanded, and are carried so
            erect, that in good birds the head and tail touch: the oil-gland is quite aborted. Several other less distinct breeds

        <witness id="1859"> Great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons, I am fully convinced that the common opinion
            of naturalists is correct, namely, that all have descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia), including under this
            term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each other in the most trifling respects. As several
            of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases, I will here briefly give
            them. If the several breeds are not varieties, and have not proceeded from the rock-pigeon, they must have descended
            from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks; for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing
            of any lesser number: how, for instance, could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the
            parent-stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop? The supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been
            rock-pigeons, that is, not breeding or willingly perching on trees. But besides C. livia, with its geographical
            sub-species, only two or three other species of rock-pigeons are known; and these have not any of the characters of the
            domestic breeds. Hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were
            originally domesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists; and this, considering their size, habits, and remarkable
            characters, seems very improbable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state. But birds breeding on precipices,
            and good fliers, are unlikely to be exterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with the
            domestic breeds, has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller British islets, or on the shores of the
            Mediterranean. Hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock-pigeon seems to
            me a very rash assumption. Moreover, the several above-named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of
            the world, and, therefore, some of them must have been carried back again into their native country; but not one has
            ever become wild or feral, though the dovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very slightly altered state, has
            become feral in several places. Again, all recent experience shows that it is most difficult to get any wild animal to
            breed freely under domestication; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons, it must be assumed that
            at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite
            prolific under confinement. </witness>

            from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks; for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing
            of any lesser number: how, for instance, could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the
            parent-stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop? The supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been
            rock-pigeons, that is, not breeding or willingly perching on trees. But besides C. livia, with its geographical
            sub-species, only two or three other species of rock-pigeons are known; and these have not any of the characters of the
            domestic breeds. Hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were
            originally domesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists; and this, considering their size, habits, and remarkable
            characters, seems very improbable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state. But birds breeding on precipices,
            and good fliers, are unlikely to be exterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with the
            domestic breeds, has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller British islets, or on the shores of the
            Mediterranean. Hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock-pigeon seems to
            me a very rash assumption. Moreover, the several above-named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of
            the world, and, therefore, some of them must have been carried back again into their native country; but not one has
            ever become wild or feral, though the dovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very slightly altered state, has
            become feral in several places. Again, all recent experience shows that it is most difficult to get any wild animal to
            breed freely under domestication; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons, it must be assumed that
            at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite

        <witness id="1859"> Some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration. The rock-pigeon is of a
            slaty-blue, and has a white rump (the Indian sub-species, C. intermedia of Strickland, having it bluish); the tail has a
            terminal dark bar, with the bases of the outer feathers externally edged with white; the wings have two black bars; some
            semi-domestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have, besides the two black bars, the wings chequered with
            black. These several marks do not occur together in any other species of the whole family. Now, in every one of the
            domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all the above marks, even to the white edging of the outer
            tail-feathers, sometimes concur perfectly developed. Moreover, when two birds belonging to two distinct breeds are
            crossed, neither of which is blue or has any of the above-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly
            to acquire these characters; for instance, I crossed some uniformly white fantails with some uniformly black barbs, and
            they produced mottled brown and black birds; these I again crossed together, and one grandchild of the pure white
            fantail and pure black barb was of as beautiful a blue colour, with the white rump, double black wing-bar, and barred
            and white-edged tail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! We can understand these facts, on the well-known principle of
            reversion to ancestral characters, if all the domestic breeds have descended from the rock-pigeon. But if we deny this,
            we must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions. Either, firstly, that all the several imagined
            aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the rock-pigeon, although no other existing species is thus coloured and
            marked, so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to revert to the very same colours and markings. Or,
            secondly, that each breed, even the purest, has within a dozen or, at most, within a score of generations, been crossed
            by the rock-pigeon: I say within a dozen or twenty generations, for we know of no fact countenancing the belief that the
            child ever reverts to some one ancestor, removed by a greater number of generations. In a breed which has been crossed
            only once with some distinct breed, the tendency to reversion to any character derived from such cross will naturally
            become less and less, as in each succeeding generation there will be less of the foreign blood; but when there has been
            no cross with a distinct breed, and there is a tendency in both parents to revert to a character, which has been lost
            during some former generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished

            were dusky and mottled. I then crossed one of the mongrel barb-fantails with a mongrel barb-spot, and they produced a
            bird of as beautiful a blue colour, with the white croup, double black wing-bar, and barred and white-edged
            tail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! We can understand these facts, on the well-known principle of reversion to
            ancestral characters (confined, as far as I have seen, to colour alone), if all the domestic breeds have descended from
            the rock-pigeon. But if we deny this, we must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions. Either,
            firstly, that all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the rock-pigeon, although no
            other existing species is thus coloured and marked, so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to revert
            to the very same colours and markings. Or, secondly, that each breed, even the purest, has within a dozen, or at most
            within a score, of generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon: I say within a dozen or twenty generations, for we know
            of no fact countenancing the belief that the child ever reverts to some one ancestor, removed by a greater number of
            generations. In a breed which has been crossed only once with some distinct breed, the tendency to reversion to any
            character derived from such cross will naturally become less and less, as in each succeeding generation there will be
            less of the foreign blood; but when there has been no cross with a distinct breed, and there is a tendency in both
            parents to revert to a character which has been lost during some former generation, this tendency, for all that we can
            see to the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations. These two quite distinct
            cases are often confounded by those who have written on inheritance. </witness>

        <witness id="1859"> In favour of this view, I may add, firstly, that C. livia, or the rock-pigeon, has been found capable of
            domestication in Europe and in India; and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all
            the domestic breeds. Secondly, although an English carrier or short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain
            characters from the rock-pigeon, yet by comparing the several sub-breeds of these breeds, more especially those brought
            from distant countries, we can make an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure. Thirdly, those
            characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed, for instance the wattle and length of beak of the carrier, the
            shortness of that of the tumbler, and the number of tail-feathers in the fantail, are in each breed eminently variable;
            and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when we come to treat of selection. Fourthly, pigeons have been
            watched, and tended with the utmost care, and loved by many people. They have been domesticated for thousands of years
            in several quarters of the world; the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth ægyptian dynasty, about 3000
            B.C., as was pointed out to me by Professor Lepsius; but Mr. Birch informs me that pigeons are given in a bill of fare
            in the previous dynasty. In the time of the Romans, as we hear from Pliny, immense prices were given for pigeons;
            &quot;nay, they are come to this pass, that they can reckon up their pedigree and race.&quot; Pigeons were much
            valued by Akber Khan in India, about the year 1600; never less than 20,000 pigeons were taken with the court.
            &quot;The monarchs of Iran and Turan sent him some very rare birds;&quot; and, continues the courtly historian,
            &quot;His Majesty by crossing the breeds, which method was never practised before, has improved them
            astonishingly.&quot; About this same period the Dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old Romans. The
            paramount importance of these considerations in explaining the immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone,
            will be obvious when we treat of Selection. We shall then, also, see how it is that the breeds so often have a somewhat
            monstrous character. It is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct breeds, that male and
            female pigeons can be easily mated for life; and thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary. </witness>

            valued by Akber Khan in India, about the year 1600; never less than 20,000 pigeons were taken with the court.
            &quot;The monarchs of Iran and Turan sent him some very rare birds;&quot; and, continues the courtly historian,

            monstrous character. It is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct breeds, that male and
            female pigeons can be easily mated for life; and thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary. </witness>

            domestication in Europe and in India; and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all
            the domestic breeds. Secondly, although an English carrier or short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain
            characters from the rock-pigeon, yet by comparing the several sub-breeds of these varieties, more especially those

        <witness id="1859"> I have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some, yet quite insufficient, length;
            because when I first kept pigeons and watched the several kinds, knowing well how true they bred, I felt fully as much

            similar conclusion in regard to the many species of finches, or other large groups of birds, in nature. One circumstance
            has struck me much; namely, that all the breeders of the various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with
            whom I have ever conversed, or whose treatises I have read, are firmly convinced that the several breeds to which each
            has attended, are descended from so many aboriginally distinct species. Ask, as I have asked, a celebrated raiser of

        <witness id="1859"> Selection . — Let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been produced, either
            from one or from several allied species. Some little effect may, perhaps, be attributed to the direct action of the
            external conditions of life, and some little to habit; but he would be a bold man who would account by such agencies for
            the differences of a dray and race horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon. One of the most
            remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we see in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal's or plant's
            own good, but to man's use or fancy. Some variations useful to him have probably arisen suddenly, or by one step; many
            botanists, for instance, believe that the fuller's teazle, with its hooks, which cannot be rivalled by any mechanical

        <witness id="1859"> What English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous prices given for animals with a
            good pedigree; and these have now been exported to almost every quarter of the world. The improvement is by no means
            generally due to crossing different breeds; all the best breeders are strongly opposed to this practice, except
            sometimes amongst closely allied sub-breeds. And when a cross has been made, the closest selection is far more
            indispensable even than in ordinary cases. If selection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety, and
            breeding from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice; but its importance consists in the
            great effect produced by the accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of differences absolutely
            inappreciable by an uneducated eye — differences which I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. Not one man in a
            thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder. If gifted with these qualities, and
            he studies his subject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance, he will succeed, and may
            make great improvements; if he wants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail. Few would readily believe in the

        <witness id="1859"> It may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to methodical practice for scarcely
            more than three-quarters of a century; it has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises have
            been published on the subject; and the result, I may add, has been, in a corresponding degree, rapid and important. But
            it is very far from true that the principle is a modern discovery. I could give several references to the full
            acknowledgment of the importance of the principle in works of high antiquity. In rude and barbarous periods of English
            history choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to prevent their exportation: the destruction of horses
            under a certain size was ordered, and this may be compared to the &quot;roguing&quot; of plants by nurserymen.
            The principle of selection I find distinctly given in an ancient Chinese encyclopædia. Explicit rules are laid down by
            some of the Roman classical writers. From passages in Genesis, it is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at
            that early period attended to. Savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to improve the breed,
            and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages in Pliny. The savages in South Africa match their draught cattle by
            colour, as do some of the Esquimaux their teams of dogs. Livingstone shows how much good domestic breeds are valued by
            the negroes of the interior of Africa who have not associated with Europeans. Some of these facts do not show actual
            selection, but they show that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times, and is now
            attended to by the lowest savages. It would, indeed, have been a strange fact, had attention not been paid to breeding,

            animals, is more important. Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can, and

        <witness id="1859"> On the view here given of the all-important part which selection by man has played, it becomes at once
            obvious, how it is that our domestic races show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man's wants or
            fancies. We can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal character of our domestic races, and likewise their
            differences being so great in external characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs. Man can hardly
            select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he
            rarely cares for what is internal. He can never act by selection, excepting on variations which are first given to him
            in some slight degree by nature. No man would ever try to make a fantail, till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in
            some slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size; and the
            more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared, the more likely it would be to catch his attention.
            But to use such an expression as trying to make a fantail, is, I have no doubt, in most cases, utterly incorrect. The
            man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail, never dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon would
            become through long-continued, partly unconscious and partly methodical selection. Perhaps the parent bird of all
            fantails had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded, like the present Java fantail, or like individuals of other

            fashion, — perhaps more in one district than in another, according to the state of civilisation of the inhabitants, —
            slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed, whatever they may be. But the chance will be infinitely small

        <witness id="1872"> These views appear to explain what has sometimes been noticed — namely, that we know hardly anything
            about the origin or history of any of our domestic breeds. But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language, can
            hardly be said to have a distinct origin. A man preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of
            structure, or takes more care than usual in matching his best animals, and thus improves them, and the improved animals
            slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood. But they will as yet hardly have a distinct name, and from being only
            slightly valued, their history will have been disregarded. When further improved by the same slow and gradual process,
            they will spread more widely, and will be recognised as something distinct and valuable, and will then probably first
            receive a provincial name. In semi-civilised countries, with little free communication, the spreading of a new sub-breed
            would be a slow process. As soon as the points of value are once acknowledged, the principle, as I have called it, of
            unconscious selection will always tend, — perhaps more at one period than at another, as the breed rises or falls in

            selection. A high degree of variability is obviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to work
            on; not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient, with extreme care, to allow of the accumulation of a
            large amount of modification in almost any desired direction. But as variations manifestly useful or pleasing to man
            appear only occasionally, the chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being
            kept; and hence this comes to be of the highest importance to success. On this principle Marshall has remarked, with

            small lots , they never can be improved.&quot; On the other hand, nurserymen, from raising large stocks of the same
            plants, are generally far more successful than amateurs in getting new and valuable varieties. The keeping of a large
            number of individuals of a species in any country requires that the species should be placed under favourable conditions
            of life, so as to breed freely in that country. When the individuals of any species are scanty, all the individuals,
            whatever their quality may be, will generally be allowed to breed, and this will effectually prevent selection. But
            probably the most important point of all, is, that the animal or plant should be so highly useful to man, or so much
            valued by him, that the closest attention should be paid to even the slightest deviation in the qualities or structure
            of each individual. Unless such attention be paid nothing can be effected. I have seen it gravely remarked, that it was

            easily matched, and, although so much valued by women and children, we rarely see a distinct breed long kept up; such
            breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country. Although I do not doubt that some
            domestic animals vary less than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat, the donkey, peacock,
            goose, &amp;c., may be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the
            difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by poor people, and little attention paid to their
            breeding; for recently in certain parts of Spain and of the United States this animal has been surprisingly modified and
            improved by careful selection; in peacocks, from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese, from
            being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in the
            display of distinct breeds; but the goose, under the conditions to which it is exposed when domesticated, seems to have
            a singularly inflexible organisation, though it has varied to a slight extent, as I have elsewhere described. </witness>

        <witness id="1869"> Some authors have maintained that the amount of variation in our domestic productions is soon reached,
            and can never afterwards be exceeded. It would be somewhat rash to assert that the limit has been attained in any one
            case; for almost all our animals and plants have been greatly improved in many ways within a recent period; and this
            implies variation. It would be equally rash to assert that characters now increased to their utmost limit, could not,
            after remaining fixed for many centuries, again vary under new conditions of life. No doubt, as Mr. Wallace has remarked
            with much truth, a limit will be at last reached. For instance there must be a limit to the fleetness of any terrestrial
            animal, as this will be determined by the friction to be overcome, the weight of body to be carried, and the power of
            contraction in the muscular fibres. But what concerns us is that the domestic varieties of the same species differ from
            each other in almost every character, which man has attended to and selected, more than do the distinct species of the
            same genera. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire has proved this in regard to size, and so it is with colour and probably with
            the length of hair. With respect to fleetness, which depends on many bodily characteristics, Eclipse was far fleeter,
            and a dray-horse is incomparably stronger than any two equine species. So with plants, the seeds of the different
            varieties of the bean or maize differ more in size, than do the seeds of the distinct species in any one genus of the
            same two families. The same remark holds good in regard to the fruit of the several varieties of the plum, and still
            more so with the melon, as well as in endless other analogous cases. </witness>
