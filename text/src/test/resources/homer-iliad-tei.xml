<head>INTRODUCTION.</head>

<p>Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of
scepticism. To be content with what we at present know, is, for the
most part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very
gradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and
emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set
aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be
daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and
anxiety to acquire.</p>

<p>And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which
progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which
persons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu
of their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away
traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues
of sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive
superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The
credulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as
powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy
scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of
conservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church.
History and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent
times, are subjected to very different handling from that which the
indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere statements are
jealously watched, and the motives of the writer form as important an
ingredient in the analysis of his history, as the facts he records.
Probability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it is by this
troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is
sifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its
demands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere
facts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of extended experience,
is the best help to the criticism of human history. Historical
characters can only be estimated by the standard which human
experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form
correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a
great whole—we must measure them by their relation to the mass of
beings by whom they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents
in their<pb n="x" /><anchor id="Pgx" /> lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we
must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than
the respective probability of its details.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know
least, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere<note place="foot"><p>"What," says Archdeacon Wilberforce, "is the natural root of loyalty as
distinguished from such mere selfish desire of personal security as is
apt to take its place in civilized times, but that consciousness of a
natural bond among the families of men which gives a fellow-feeling to
whole clans and nations, and thus enlists their affections in behalf of
those time-honoured representatives of their ancient blood, in whose
success they feel a personal interest? Hence the delight when we
recognize an act of nobility or justice in our hereditary princes</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"'Tuque prior, tu parce genus qui ducis Olympo,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Projice tela manu <hi rend="font-style: italic">sanguis meus</hi>'</l>
</lg>

<p>"So strong is this feeling, that it regains an engrafted influence even
when history witnesses that vast convulsions have rent and weakened it
and the Celtic feeling towards the Stuarts has been rekindled in our
own days towards the grand daughter of George the Third of Hanover.</p>

<p>"Somewhat similar may be seen in the disposition to idolize those great
lawgivers of man's race, who have given expression, in the immortal
language of song, to the deeper inspirations of our nature. The
thoughts of Homer or of Shakespere are the universal inheritance of the
human race. In this mutual ground every man meets his brother, they
have been bet forth by the providence of God to vindicate for all of us
what nature could effect, and that, in these representatives of our
race, we might recognize our common benefactors.'—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Doctrine of the
Incarnation,</hi> pp. 9, 10.</p></note> have, perhaps, contributed more to the
intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any other three writers who
could be named, and yet the history of all three has given rise to a
boundless ocean of discussion, which has left us little save the option
of choosing which theory or theories we will follow. The personality of
Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in which critics will allow us
to believe without controversy; but upon everything else, even down to
the authorship of plays, there is more or less of doubt and
uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the contradictions of
Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one of the <hi rend="font-style: italic">dramatis
personae</hi> in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style. He
appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as
those of the writers who have handed them down. When we have read Plato
<hi rend="font-style: italic">or</hi> Xenophon, we think we know something of Socrates; when we
have fairly read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are
something worse than ignorant.</p>

<p>It has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny
the personal or real existence of men and things whose life and
condition were too much for our belief. This system—which has often
comforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of
Strauss for those of the New Testament—has been of incalculable value
to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries. To
question the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more
excusable act, than to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a fact
related in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory
developed from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in
the same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured
old king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Numa
Pompilius.</hi></p>

<p>Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer,
and the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free
permission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard<pb n="xi" /><anchor id="Pgxi" /> all
written tradition, concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and
Odyssey. What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily
dismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. "This
cannot be true, because it is not true; and, that is not true, because
it cannot be true." Such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon
testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and
oblivion.</p>

<p>It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are
partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which
truth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of
the Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken
of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to
Herodotus.</p>

<p>According to this document, the city of Cumae in Æolia, was, at an
early period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of
Greece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes.
Although poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl named
Critheis. The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the
guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this
maiden that we "are indebted for so much happiness." Homer was the
first fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of
Melesigenes, from having been born near the river Meles, in Boeotia,
whither Critheis had been transported in order to save her reputation.</p>

<p>"At this time," continues our narrative, "there lived at Smyrna a man
named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being
married, engaged Critheis to manage his household, and spin the flax he
received as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was
her performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made
proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement,
willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man,
if he were carefully brought up."</p>

<p>They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature
had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every
attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius
died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon
followed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father's school with great
success, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna,
but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially
in the exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these
visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who
evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times,
persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his
travels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him
with a further stipend, urging, that, "While he was yet young, it was
fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities
which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses." Melesigenes
consented, and set out with his patron, "examining all the curiosities
of the countries they visited, and informing himself of everything by
interrogating those whom he met." We may also suppose, that he<pb n="xii" /><anchor id="Pgxii" /> wrote
memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation<note place="foot"><p>Eikos
de min aen kai mnaemoruna panton grapherthai. Vit. Hom. in Schweigh
Herodot t. iv. p. 299, sq. Section 6. I may observe that this Life has
been paraphrased in English by my learned young friend Kenneth R. H.
Mackenzie, and appended to my prose translation of the Odyssey. The
present abridgement however, will contain all that is of use to the
reader, for the biographical value of the treatise is most
insignificant.</p></note> Having set sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached
Ithaca. Here Melesigenes, who had already suffered in his eyes, became
much worse, and Mentes, who was about to leave for Leucadia, left him
to the medical superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the
son of Alcinor. Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes
rapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which
afterwards formed the subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca
assert, that it was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the
Colophomans make their city the seat of that misfortune. He then
returned to Smyrna, where he applied himself to the study of poetry.<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">I.e.</hi> both of composing and reciting verses for as Blair
observes, "The first poets sang their own verses." Sextus Empir.
adv. Mus. p. 360 ed. Fabric. Ou hamelei ge toi kai oi poiaetai
melopoioi legontai, kai ta Omaerou epae to palai pros lyran aedeto.</p>

<p>"The voice," observes Heeren, "was always accompanied by some
instrument. The bard was provided with a harp on which he played a
prelude, to elevate and inspire his mind, and with which he accompanied
the song when begun. His voice probably preserved a medium between
singing and recitation; the words, and not the melody were regarded by
the listeners, hence it was necessary for him to remain intelligible to
all. In countries where nothing similar is found, it is difficult to
represent such scenes to the mind; but whoever has had an opportunity
of listening to the improvisation of Italy, can easily form an idea of
Demodocus and Phemius."—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Ancient Greece,</hi> p. 94.</p></note></p>

<p>But poverty soon drove him to Cumae. Having passed over the Hermaean
plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumae.
Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of
one Tychias, an armourer. "And up to my time," continued the author,
"the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a
recitation of his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also
a poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes
arrived".<note place="foot"><p>"Should it not be, since <hi rend="font-style: italic">my</hi> arrival? asks
Mackenzie, observing that "poplars can hardly live so long".  But
setting aside the fact that we must not expect consistency in a mere
romance, the ancients had a superstitious belief in the great age of
trees which grew near places consecrated by the presence of gods and
great men. See Cicero de Legg II I, sub init., where he speaks of the
plane tree under which Socrates used to walk and of the tree at Delos,
where Latona gave birth to Apollo. This passage is referred to by
Stephanus of Byzantium, <hi rend="font-style: italic">s. v.</hi> N. T. p. 490, ed. de Pinedo. I
omit quoting any of the dull epigrams ascribed to Homer for, as Mr.
Justice Talfourd rightly observes, "The authenticity of these fragments
depends upon that of the pseudo Herodotean Life of Homer, from which
they are taken." Lit of Greece, pp. 38 in Encycl. Metrop. Cf.
Coleridge, Classic Poets, p. 317.</p></note></p>

<p>But poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being
the most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph
on Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater
probability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.<note place="foot"><p>It is
quoted as the work of Cleobulus, by Diogenes Laert. Vit. Cleob. p. 62,
ed. Casaub.</p></note></p>

<p>Arrived at Cumae, he frequented the <hi rend="font-style: italic">converzationes</hi><note place="foot"><p>I
trust I am justified in employing this as an equivalent for the Greek
leschai.</p></note> of the old men, and delighted all by the charms of his
poetry. Encouraged by this favourable reception, he declared that, if
they would allow him a public maintenance, he would render their city
most gloriously  renowned.<pb n="xiii" /><anchor id="Pgxiii" /> They avowed their willingness to support him
in the measure he proposed, and procured him an audience in the
council. Having made the speech, with the purport of which our author
has forgotten to acquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate
respecting the answer to be given to his proposal.</p>

<p>The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet's
demand, but one man observed that "if they were to feed <hi rend="font-style: italic">Homers,</hi>
they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people." "From
this circumstance," says the writer, "Melesigenes acquired the name of
Homer, for the Cumans call blind men <hi rend="font-style: italic">Homers.</hi>"<note place="foot"><p>Os ei

recent scholars. See Welcker, Epische Cyclus, p. 127, and Mackenzie's
note, p. xiv.</p></note> With a love of economy, which shows how similar the
world has always been in its treatment of literary men, the pension was
denied, and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that Cumoea
might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory.</p>

<p>At Phocoea, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.
One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept
Homer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the
verses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficient
poetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary
publishers, neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him.
At his departure, Homer is said to have observed: "O Thestorides, of
the many things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more
unintelligible than the human heart."<note place="foot"><p>Thestorides,
thnetoisin anoiston poleon per, ouden aphrastoteron peletai noou
anthropoisin. Ibid. p. 315. During his stay at Phocoea, Homer is said
to have composed the Little Iliad, and the Phocoeid. See Muller's Hist.
of Lit., vi. Section 3. Welcker, <hi rend="font-style: italic">l. c.</hi> pp. 132, 272, 358, sqq.,
and Mure, Gr. Lit. vol. ii. p. 284, sq.</p></note></p>

<p>Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian
merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him
recite, acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a
profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at
once determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be
setting sail thither, but he found one ready to Start for Erythrae, a
town of Ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the
seamen to allow him to accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a
favourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the
imposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn
down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.</p>

<p>At Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in
Phocoea, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty,
reached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure,
which we will continue in the words of our author. "Having set out from
Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were
pasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus
(for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up
quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For or
some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have<pb n="xiv" /><anchor id="Pgxiv" /> reached such a
place alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then went up to
him, and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate places
and untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting
to him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion;
and he took him, and led him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade
him sup.<note place="foot"><p>This is so pretty a picture of early manners and
hospitality, that it is almost a pity to find that it is obviously a
copy from the Odyssey. See the fourteenth book. In fact, whoever was
the author of this fictitious biography, he showed some tact in
identifying Homer with certain events described in his poems, and in
eliciting from them the germs of something like a personal narrative.</p></note></p>

<p>"The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according
to their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O
Glaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs
their supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since,
whilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.</p>

<p>Glaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author.
Having finished supper, they banqueted<note place="foot"><p>Dia logon estionto. A
common metaphor. So Plato calls the parties conversing daitumones, or

conversation, Homer narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities
he had visited.</p>

<p>At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus
resolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with
Homer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left
Homer at home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus,
a place near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole
story respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to
what he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and
feeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the
stranger to him.</p>

<p>Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him,
assuring him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon
showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general
knowledge, and the Chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the
charge of his children.<note place="foot"><p>It was at Bolissus, and in the house
of this Chian citizen, that Homer is said to have written the
Batrachomyomachia, or Battle of the Frogs and Mice, the Epicichlidia,
and some other minor works.</p></note></p>

<p>Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the
island, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of
Chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry.
"To this day," says Chandler,<note place="foot"><p>Chandler, Travels,  vol. i. p.
61, referred to in the Voyage Pittoresque dans la Grece, vol. i. P. 92,
where a view of the spot is given of which the author candidly says,—
"Je ne puis repondre d'une exactitude scrupuleuse dans la vue generale
que j'en donne, car etant alle seul pour l'examiner je perdis mon
crayon, et je fus oblige de m'en fier a ma memoire. Je ne crois
cependant pas avoir trop a me plaindre d'elle en cette occasion."</p></note> "the
most curious remain is that which has been named, without reason, the
School of Homer. It is on the coast, at some distance from the city,
northward, and appears to have been an open temple of Cybele, formed on
the top of a rock. The shape is oval, and in the centre is the image of
the goddess, the<pb n="xv" /><anchor id="Pgxv" /> head and an arm wanting. She is represented, as usual,
sitting. The chair has a lion carved on each side, and on the back. The
area is bounded by a low rim, or seat, and about five yards over. The
whole is hewn out of the mountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of
the most remote antiquity."</p>

<p>So successful was this school, that Homer realised a considerable
fortune. He married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single,
the other married a Chian.</p>

<p>The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the
personages of the poems with the history of the poet, which has already
been mentioned:—</p>

<p>"In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards
Mentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his
poem as the companion of Ulysses,<note place="foot"><p>A more probable reason for
this companionship, and for the character of Mentor itself, is given by
the allegorists, viz.: the assumption of Mentor's form by the guardian
deity of the wise Ulysses, Minerva. The classical reader may compare
Plutarch, Opp. t. ii. p. 880; <hi rend="font-style: italic">Xyland.</hi> Heraclid. Pont. Alleg.
Hom. p. 531-5, of Gale's Opusc. Mythol. Dionys. Halic. de Hom. Poes. c.
15; Apul. de Deo Socrat. s. f.</p></note> in return for the care taken of him
when afflicted with blindness. He also testifies his gratitude to
Phemius, who had given him both sustenance and instruction."</p>

<p>His celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to
visit Greece, whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is
said, made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity
of the Athenians, of whose city he had hitherto made no
mention,<note place="foot"><p>Vit. Hom. Section 28.</p></note> he sent out for Samos. Here
being recognized by a Samian, who had met with him in Chios, he was
handsomely received, and invited to join in celebrating the Apaturian
festival. He recited some verses, which gave great satisfaction, and by
singing the Eiresione at the New Moon festivals, he earned a
subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich, with whose children he
was very popular.</p>

<p>In the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios,
now Ino, where he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that his
death arose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma
proposed by some fishermen's children.<note place="foot"><p>The riddle is given in
Section 35. Compare Mackenzie's note, p. xxx.</p></note></p>

<p>Such is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we
possess, and so broad are the evidences of its historical
worthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in
detail. Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a
persevering, patient, and learned—but by no means consistent—series
of investigations has led. In doing so, I profess to bring forward
statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability.</p>

<p>"Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost in
doubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who
have done honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The
majestic stream of his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the
Nile, through many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the
Nile, its fountains will ever remain concealed."</p>

<pb n="xvi" /><anchor id="Pgxvi" />

<p>Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics
has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the
Homeric question is involved. With no less truth and feeling he
proceeds:—</p>

<p>"It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of
things makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the
region of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The
creations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for
the most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were
in possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly
explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in
all essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet."
<note place="foot"><p>Heeren's Ancient Greece, p. 96.</p></note></p>

<p>From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of
human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic
investigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer
an individual?<note place="foot"><p>Compare Sir E. L. Bulwer's Caxtons v. i. p.
4.</p></note> or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious
arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?</p>

<p>Well has Landor remarked: "Some tell us there were twenty Homers; some
deny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the
contents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are
perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our
devotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know
what is good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our
admiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do."
<note place="foot"><p>Pericles and Aspasia, Letter lxxxiv., Works, vol ii. p.
387.</p></note></p>

<p>But, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented
with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and
fostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions
by minute analysis—our editorial office compels us to give some
attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric
question is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to
prefer his judgment to his imagination, and to condescend to dry
details.</p>

<p>Before, however, entering into particulars respecting the question of
this unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) I must
express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following
remarks:—</p>

<p>"We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the
better, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its
original composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that
its primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to
assert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not
the best qualification for the profound feeling, the comprehensive
conception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite anatomist may be
no judge of the symmetry of the human frame: and we would take the
opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty
of a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper.</p>

to detail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of Homer ever
arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our
early ideas on the subject; let us now see what are the discoveries to
which more modern investigations lay claim.</p>

<p>At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on
the subject, and we find Bentley remarking that "Homer wrote a sequel
of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and
good cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs
were not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about
Peisistratus' time, about five hundred years after."<note place="foot"><p>Letters
to Phileleuth; Lips.</p></note></p>

<p>Two French writers—Hedelin and Perrault—avowed a similar scepticism
on the subject; but it is in the "Scienza Nuova" of Battista Vico, that
we first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by
Wolf with so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the
Wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following
bold hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote<note place="foot"><p>Hist. of Greece, vol. ii. p. 191, sqq.</p></note>—</p>

<p>"Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,
turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been<pb n="xviii" /><anchor id="Pgxviii" /> recently
published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of
the Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by
no means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously
announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent
portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into
any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of
Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards
that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem
could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their
composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect
symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived
by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to
posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be
indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks,
was thus one of the points in Wolf's case against the primitive
integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading
opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to
have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered
incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the
Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the
beginning.</p>

<p>"To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to
Peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are
nowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that
view of the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to
controvert it, we were driven to the necessity of admitting long
written poems, in the ninth century before the Christian aera. Few
things, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight,
opposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than
Wolf himself. The traces of writing in Greece, even in the seventh
century before the Christian aera, are exceedingly trifling. We have no
remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad, and the early
inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even assure
ourselves whether Archilochus, Simonides of Amorgus, Kallinus,
Tyrtaeus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and lyric poets,
committed their compositions to writing, or at what time the practice
of doing so became familiar. The first positive ground which authorizes
us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in the famous
ordinance of Solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at the Panathenaea:
but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed, we are
unable to say.</p>

<p>"Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the
beginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the
existing habits of society with regard to poetry—for they admit
generally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and
heard,—but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been
manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems—the unassisted
memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy. But here
we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater; for the
existence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary memory,<pb n="xix" /><anchor id="Pgxix" />
<note place="foot"><p>It is, indeed not easy to calculate the height to which the
memory may be cultivated. To take an ordinary case, we might refer to
that of any first rate actor, who must be prepared, at a very short
warning, to 'rhapsodize,' night after night, parts which when laid
together, would amount to an immense number of lines. But all this is
nothing to two instances of our own day. Visiting at Naples a gentleman
of the highest intellectual attainments, and who held a distinguished
rank among the men of letters in the last century, he informed us that
the day before he had passed much time in examining a man, not highly
educated, who had learned to repeat the whole Gierusalemme of Tasso,
not only to recite it consecutively, but also to repeat those stanzas
in utter defiance of the sense, either forwards or backwards, or from
the eighth line to the first, alternately the odd and even lines—in
short, whatever the passage required; the memory, which seemed to cling
to the words much more than to the sense, had it at such perfect
command, that it could produce it under any form. Our informant went on
to state that this singular being was proceeding to learn the Orlando
Furioso in the same manner. But even this instance is less wonderful
than one as to which we may appeal to any of our readers that happened
some twenty years ago to visit the town of Stirling, in Scotland. No
such person can have forgotten the poor, uneducated man Blind Jamie who
could actually repeat, after a few minutes consideration any verse
required from any part of the Bible—even the obscurest and most
unimportant enumeration of mere proper names not excepted. We do not
mention these facts as touching the more difficult part of the question
before us, but facts they are; and if we find so much difficulty in
calculating the extent to which the mere memory may be cultivated, are
we, in these days of multifarious reading, and of countless distracting
affairs, fair judges of the perfection to which the invention and the
memory combined may attain in a simpler age, and among a more single
minded people?—Quarterly Review, <hi rend="font-style: italic">l. c.,</hi> p. 143, sqq.</p>

<p>Heeren steers between the two opinions, observing that, "The
Dschungariade of the Calmucks is said to surpass the poems of Homer in
length, as much as it stands beneath them in merit, and yet it exists
only in the memory of a people which is not unacquainted with writing.
But the songs of a nation are probably the last things which are
committed to writing, for the very reason that they are remembered."—
<hi rend="font-style: italic">Ancient Greece.</hi> p. 100.</p></note> is far less astonishing than that of
long manuscripts, in an age essentially non-reading and non-writing,
and when even suitable instruments and materials for the process are
not obvious. Moreover, there is a strong positive reason for believing
that the bard was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by
consulting a manuscript; for if such had been the fact, blindness would
have been a disqualification for the profession, which we know that it
was not, as well from the example of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from
that of the blind bard of Chios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom
Thucydides, as well as the general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies
with Homer himself. The author of that hymn, be he who he may, could
never have described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in
his art, if he had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only
maintained by constant reference to the manuscript in his chest."</p>

<p>The loss of the digamma, that <hi rend="font-style: italic">crux</hi> of critics, that quicksand
upon which even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove
beyond a doubt, that the pronunciation of the Greek language had
undergone a considerable change. Now it is certainly difficult to
suppose that the Homeric poems could have suffered by this change, had
written copies been preserved. If Chaucer's poetry, for instance, had
not been written, it could only have come down to us in a softened
form, more like the effeminate version of Dryden, than the rough,
quaint, noble original.</p>

<p>"At what period," continues Grote, "these poems, or indeed any other
Greek poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture,
though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of
Solon. If, in the absence of evidence, we may venture upon<pb n="xx" /><anchor id="Pgxx" /> naming any
more determinate period, the question a once suggests itself, What were
the purposes which, in that state of society, a manuscript at its first
commencement must have been intended to answer? For whom was a written
Iliad necessary? Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was not only
planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the feelings, and
conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of
voice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were required for
emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never
reproduce. Not for the general public—they were accustomed to receive
it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn
and crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would
be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of
readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had
experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the
written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the
impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may
seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and
there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed.
If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be
formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic
poems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with
the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the
formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle
of the seventh century before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C.
630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonides of
Amorgus, &amp;c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in
the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music—the elegiac
and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the
primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred
from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a
change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of
publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the
nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at
the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new
poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be
considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their
own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric
rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and
eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer. There seems,
therefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this newly-formed
and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of the
Homeric poems and other old epics,—the Thebais and the Cypria, as well
as the Iliad and the Odyssey,—began to be compiled towards the middle
of the seventh century (B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to Grecian
commerce, which took place about the same period, would furnish
increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon.
A reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly increase, and
the number of manuscripts along with it; so that before the time of
Solon, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though
still comparatively few, might have attained a<pb n="xxi" /><anchor id="Pgxxi" /> certain recognized
authority, and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness
of individual rhapsodes."<note place="foot"><p>Vol. II p. 198, sqq.</p></note></p>

<p>But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of
the credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following
observations—</p>

<quote rend="display">
<p>"There are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion,
throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid
compilation, at least over the theory, that the Iliad was cast into its
present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian
ruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the bright period of
Grecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited little more than the
fame, and the faint echo, if Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonides were
employed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much
must have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is
almost incredible, that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should
not remain. Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies
which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the
Homeric age, however the irregular use of the digamma may have
perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have
caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the
heroes of her age, however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the
Homeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic
dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing
characteristics—still it is difficult to suppose that the language,
particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts,
should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient
and modern forms of expression. It is not quite in character with such
a period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an
imperfect poem in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott
has done in his continuation of Sir Tristram.</p>

<p>"If, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian
compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total
absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of
observation. In later, and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times,
the Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their
ancestors. But, amid all the traditions of the glories of early Greece
embodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and
insignificant part. Even the few passages which relate to their
ancestors, Mr. Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible,
indeed, that in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic
fact, that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against
the rival and half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadae, the chieftain
of Thessaly, from his valour and the number of his forces, may have
been the most important ally of the Peloponnesian sovereign; the preeminent
value of the ancient poetry on the Trojan war may thus have
forced the national feeling of the Athenians to yield to their taste.
The songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were, no doubt, of
far inferior sublimity and popularity, or, at first sight, a Theseid
would have been much more likely to have emanated from an Athenian
synod of compilers of<pb n="xxii" /><anchor id="Pgxxii" /> ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Olysseid.
Could France have given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the
hero of the Jerusalem. If, however, the Homeric ballads, as they are
sometimes called, which related the wrath of Achilles, with all its
direful consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the poetic
cycle, as to admit no rivalry,—it is still surprising, that throughout
the whole poem the <hi rend="font-style: italic">callida junctura</hi> should never betray the
workmanship of an Athenian hand, and that the national spirit of a
race, who have at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self
admiring neighbours, the French, should submit with lofty self denial
to the almost total exclusion of their own ancestors—or, at least, to
the questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably
skilled in the military tactics of his age."<note place="foot"><p>Quarterly
Review, <hi rend="font-style: italic">l. c.,</hi> p. 131 sq.</p></note></p>
</quote>

<p>To return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that
Wolf's objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey
have never been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they
have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the
difficulties with which the whole subject is beset, are rather
augmented than otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis. Nor is Lachmann's<note place="foot"><p>Betrachtungen uber die Ilias. Berol. 1841. See Grote, p.
204. Notes and Queries, vol. v. p. 221.</p></note> modification of his theory
any better. He divides the first twenty-two books of the Iliad into
sixteen different songs, and treats as ridiculous the belief that their
amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the
age of Peisistratus. This, as Grote observes, "explains the gaps and
contradictions in the narrative, but it explains nothing else."
Moreover, we find no contradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called
sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men
in the first battle after the secession of Achilles: Elphenor, chief of
the Euboeans; Tlepolemus, of the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians;
Odius, of the Halizonians; Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of
these heroes again make their appearance, and we can but agree with
Colonel Mure, that "it seems strange that any number of independent
poets should have so harmoniously dispensed with the services of all
six in the sequel." The discrepancy, by which Pylaemenes, who is
represented as dead in the fifth book, weeps at his son's funeral in
the thirteenth, can only be regarded as the result of an interpolation.</p>

<p>Grote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the
subject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian
theory, and of Lachmann's modifications with the character of
Peisistratus. But he has also shown, and we think with equal success,
that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems,
or, supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by
Peisistratus, and not before his time, are essentially distinct. In
short, "a man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of
pre-existing songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the
period of its first compilation." The friends or literary
<hi rend="font-style: italic">employes</hi> of Peisistratus must have found an Iliad that was
already ancient, and the silence of the Alexandrine critics respecting
the Peisistratic "recension," goes far<pb n="xxiii" /><anchor id="Pgxxiii" /> to prove, that, among the
numerous manuscripts they examined, this was either wanting, or thought
unworthy of attention.</p>

<p>"Moreover," he continues, "the whole tenor of the poems themselves
confirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad
or Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age
of Peisistratus—nothing which brings to our view the alterations
brought about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined
money, the habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican
governments, the close military array, the improved construction of
ships, the Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of
religious festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, &amp;c.,
familiar to the latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus, and the
other literary friends of Peisistratus, could hardly have failed to
notice, even without design, had they then, for the first time,
undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into
one large aggregate. Everything in the two great Homeric poems, both in
substance and in language, belongs to an age two or three centuries
earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the interpolations (or those
passages which, on the best grounds, are pronounced to be such) betray
no trace of the sixth century before Christ, and may well have been
heard by Archilochus and Kallinus—in some cases even by Arktinus and
Hesiod—as genuine Homeric matter<note place="foot"><p>Prolegg. pp. xxxii.,
xxxvi., &amp;c.</p></note> As far as the evidences on the case, as well internal as
external, enable us to judge, we seem warranted in believing that the
Iliad and Odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand (always
allowing for paitial divergences of text and interpolations) in 776
B.C., our first trustworthy mark of Grecian time; and this ancient
date, let it be added, as it is the best-authenticated fact, so it is
also the most important attribute of the Homeric poems, considered in
reference to Grecian history; for they thus afford us an insight into
the anti-historical character of the Greeks, enabling us to trace the
subsequent forward march of the nation, and to seize instructive
contrasts between their former and their later condition."<note place="foot"><p>Vol. ii. p. 214 sqq.</p></note></p>

<p>On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of
Peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, although, I must
confess, that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his
labours. At the same time, so far from believing that the composition
or primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the
work of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and
elegant mind of that Athenian<note place="foot"><p>"Who," says Cicero, de Orat.
iii. 34, "was more learned in that age, or whose eloquence is reported
to have been more perfected by literature than that of Peisistratus,
who is said first to have disposed the books of Homer in the order in
which we now have them?" Compare Wolf's Prolegomena, Section 33</p></note> would
lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems,
rather than to patch and re-construct them according to a fanciful
hypothesis. I will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether
the poems were written or not, or whether the art of writing was known
in the time of their reputed author. Suffice it to say, that the more
we read, the less satisfied we are upon either subject.</p>

<pb n="xxiv" /><anchor id="Pgxxiv" />

<p>I cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the
preservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version
of the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical
probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the
Spartan Confucius.</p>

<p>I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories, with an attempt,
made by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like
consistency. It is as follows:—</p>

<quote rend="display">
<p>"No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors
of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to 'discourse in excellent
music' among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the
United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing
around them. But what was passing around them? The grand events of a
spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the
mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides
which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and
was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first,
and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely
recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative,
probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the
memory considerably.</p>

<p>"It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a
poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most
probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great
utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of
Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays, connecting them
by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the
'Odyssea.' The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem,
which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic
dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He
therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is
rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging
arrangement of other people's ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed,
arguing for the unity of authorship, 'a great poet might have re-cast
pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere
arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.'</p>

<p>"While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad,
recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind seized
the hint that there presented itself, and the Achilleis<note place="foot"><p>"The
first book, together with the eighth, and the books from the eleventh
to the twenty-second inclusive, seems to form the primary organization
of the poem, then properly an Achilleis."—Grote, vol. ii. p. 235</p></note> grew
under his hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the
poem under the same pseudonyme as his former work: and the disjointed
lays of the ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to
the Cid, into a chronicle history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew
that the poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved;
but, first, the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and
corruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the streets,
assemblies, and agoras. However, Solon first, and then<pb n="xxv" /><anchor id="Pgxxv" /> Peisistratus,
and afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored
the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great
measure."<note place="foot"><p>K. R. H. Mackenzie, Notes and Queries, p. 222

<p>Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which
have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I
must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of
the Homeric poems. To deny that many corruptions and interpolations
disfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here
and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of
the copyist, would be an absurd and captious assumption, but it is to a
higher criticism that we must appeal, if we would either understand or
enjoy these poems. In maintaining the authenticity and personality of
their one author, be he Homer or Melesigenes, <hi rend="font-style: italic">quocunque nomine
vocari eum jus fasque sit,</hi> I feel conscious that, while the whole
weight of historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would
assign these great works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful
internal evidence, and that which springs from the deepest and most
immediate impulse of the soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary.</p>

<p>The minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise.
Indeed, considering the character of some of my own books, such an
attempt would be gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its
importance in a philological view, I am inclined to set little store on
its aesthetic value, especially in poetry. Three parts of the
emendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had
they been suggested to the author by his Maecenas or Africanus, he
would probably have adopted. Moreover, those who are most exact in
laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often
least competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not
poets by profession, but may be so <hi rend="font-style: italic">per accidens.</hi> I do not at
this moment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated to
substantially improve the poetry of a passage, although a mass of
remarks, from Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a
thousand minute points, without which our Greek knowledge would be
gloomy and jejune.</p>

<p>But it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will
exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an
heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously
dissected his words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the
pruning knife by wholesale, and inconsistent in everything but their
wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book
after book, passage after passage, till the author is reduced to a
collection of fragments, or till those, who fancied they possessed the
works of some great man, find that they have been put off with a vile
counterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare the theories of
Knight, Wolf, Lachmann, and others, we shall feel better satisfied of
the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of
Homer. One rejects what another considers the turning-point of his<pb n="xxvi" /><anchor id="Pgxxvi" />
theory. One cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would
explain by omitting something else.</p>

<p>Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon
as a literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill,
seems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies
attributed to Seneca are by <hi rend="font-style: italic">four</hi> different authors.<note place="foot"><p>See his Epistle to Raphelingius, in Schroeder's edition, 4to., Delphis,
1728.</p></note> Now, I will venture to assert, that these tragedies are so
uniform, not only in their borrowed phraseology—a phraseology with
which writers like Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than
ourselves—in their freedom from real poetry, and last, but not least,
in an ultra-refined and consistent abandonment of good taste, that few
writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the same
gentleman, be he Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a great
many more equally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin astonished
the world with the startling announcement that the Æneid of Virgil,
and the satires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now, without
wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and
learning—nay, the refined acuteness—which scholars, like Wolf, have
bestowed upon this subject, I must express my fears, that many of our
modern Homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and
entertainment, rather than the instruction, of posterity. Nor can I
help thinking, that the literary history of more recent times will
account for many points of difficulty in the transmission of the Iliad
and Odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first creation.</p>

<p>I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus
were of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason
why corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in
his day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should
have given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after
all, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand
too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully
appeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has
sought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer, does too much
violence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with
love and admiration for the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author
of the Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the powers of human
invention; to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most
ennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the ocean in the
contemplation of a polypus. There is a catholicity, so to speak, in the
very name of Homer. Our faith in the author of the Iliad may be a
mistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a better.</p>

<p>While, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature
herself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in
believing in Homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers
round the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth
of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust,—still I am
far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a
rich fund of tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse from whence<pb n="xxvii" /><anchor id="Pgxxvii" />
he might derive both subject and embellishment. But it is one thing to
<hi rend="font-style: italic">use</hi> existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to
patch up the poem itself from such materials. What consistency of style
and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what
bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?</p>

<p>A blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other
bards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In
fact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward
impressions—nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents
which support and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless there be
some grand pervading principle—some invisible, yet most distinctly
stamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never
come to the birth. Traditions the most picturesque, episodes the most
pathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and
great men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in more
substantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power to
create a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and
embellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a
parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their
wild redundancy: we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which will
require little acuteness to detect.</p>

<p>Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware
as I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief,
it still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved
for a higher criticism than it has often obtained. We are not by nature
intended to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which
the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Were
faith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our
ignorance on any matter. But we are too well taught the contrary
lesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried
touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon
the condition of humanity. And there is a kind of sacredness attached
to the memory of the great and the good, which seems to bid us repulse
the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing
apologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic
dynameter.</p>

<p>Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts
even to his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and
with a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply
wrapped in admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the minute spots
which mere analysis can discover. In reading an heroic poem we must
transform ourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination
must fight over the same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the
same sense of injury, as an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can but
attain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely
suffice for the reading of Homer), we shall feel that the poems of
Homer are not only the work of one writer, but of the greatest writer
that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song.</p>

<p>And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems
their powerful influence over the minds of the men of old.<pb n="xxviii" /><anchor id="Pgxxviii" /> Heeren, who
is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely
observes:—</p>

<quote rend="display">
<p>"It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation. No poet has
ever, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his countrymen.
Prophets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the character of other
nations; it was reserved to a poet to form that of the Greeks. This is
a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the
period of their degeneracy. When lawgivers and sages appeared in
Greece, the work of the poet had already been accomplished; and they
paid homage to his superior genius. He held up before his nation the
mirror, in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no
less than of feeble mortals, and to behold them reflected with purity
and truth. His poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature;
on the love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which
outweighs all others, the love of glory. His songs were poured forth
from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man; and
therefore they enter, and will continue to enter, every breast which
cherishes the same sympathies. If it is granted to his immortal spirit,
from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth, to look down
on his race, to see the nations from the fields of Asia to the forests
of Hercynia, performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic
wand caused to flow; if it is permitted to him to view the vast
assemblage of grand, of elevated, of glorious productions, which had
been called into being by means of his songs; wherever his immortal
spirit may reside, this alone would suffice to complete his happiness."<note place="foot"><p>Ancient Greece, p. 101.</p></note></p>

and not feel how much of pleasing association, how much that appeals
most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds, is lost by the
admittance of any theory but our old tradition? The more we read, and

preservation, let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and
eloquence thus laid open to our use, than seek to make it a mere centre

<p>As the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer, are not
included in Pope's translation, I will content myself with a brief
account of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, from the pen of a writer
who has done it full justice<note place="foot"><p>Coleridge, Classic Poets, p.
276.</p></note>:—</p>

<quote rend="display">
<p>"This poem," says Coleridge, "is a short mock-heroic of ancient date.
The text varies in different editions, and is obviously disturbed and
corrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to have been a juvenile
essay of Homer's genius; others have attributed it to the same Pigrees,<pb n="xxix" /><anchor id="Pgxxix" />
mentioned above, and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited
the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit, the author of which was
uncertain; so little did the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies,
know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining
the genuineness of ancient writings. As to this little poem being a
youthful prolusion of Homer, it seems sufficient to say that from the
beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody, not only of the
general spirit, but of the numerous passages of the Iliad itself; and
even, if no such intention to parody were discernible in it, the
objection would still remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque
to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse
that order in the development of national taste, which the history of
every other people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost
ascertained to be a law of the human mind; it is in a state of society
much more refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad, that
any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is
contained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed three
other poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see, with as
much reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe that none of
them were of the Homeric age. Knight infers from the usage of the word
deltos, "writing tablet," instead of diphthera, "skin," which,
according to Herod. 5, 58, was the material employed by the Asiatic
Greeks for that purpose, that this poem was another offspring of Attic
ingenuity; and generally that the familiar mention of the cock (v. 191)
is a strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition."</p>
</quote>

<p>Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope's
design, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation,
and on my own purpose in the present edition.</p>

<p>Pope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his
earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby.
It is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a
disposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive
deeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his
whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a
translation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes,
which prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical
attainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it
is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the
contradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a
perfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called
literal translation was less cultivated than at present. If something
like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of
a practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing
fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the
poet's meaning, his <hi rend="font-style: italic">words</hi> were less jealously sought for, and those
who could read so good a poem as Pope's Iliad had fair reason to be
satisfied.</p>

<p>It would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope's translation by our own
advancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to<pb n="xxx" /><anchor id="Pgxxx" /> look at
it as a most delightful work in itself,—a work which is as much a part
of English literature as Homer himself is of Greek. We must not be torn
from our kindly associations with the old Iliad, that once was our most
cherished companion, or our most looked-for prize, merely because
Buttmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to
amphikupellon being an adjective, and not a substantive. Far be it from
us to defend the faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman's
fine, bold, rough old English;—far be it from, us to hold up his
translation as what a translation of Homer <hi rend="font-style: italic">might</hi> be. But we can
still dismiss Pope's Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the
consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books
before they have read its fellow.</p>

<p>As to the Notes accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up
without pretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general
reader. Having some little time since translated all the works of Homer
for another publisher, I might have brought a large amount of
accumulated matter, sometimes of a critical character, to bear upon the
text. But Pope's version was no field for such a display; and my
purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions,
to notice occasionally <hi rend="font-style: italic">some</hi> departures from the original, and to
give a few parallel passages from our English Homer, Milton. In the
latter task I cannot pretend to novelty, but I trust that my other
annotations, while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views, will be
found to convey as much as is wanted; at least, as far as the necessary
limits of these volumes could be expected to admit. To write a
commentary on Homer is not my present aim; but if I have made Pope's
translation a little more entertaining and instructive to a mass of
miscellaneous readers, I shall consider my wishes satisfactorily
accomplished.</p>

<head>POPE'S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER</head>

<p>Homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any
writer whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested
with him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular
excellences; but his invention remains yet unrivalled. Nor is it a
wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most
excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the
invention that, in different degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses:
the utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry, which
masters everything besides, can never attain to this. It furnishes art
with all her materials, and without it judgment itself can at best but
"steal wisely:" for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on
managing the riches of nature. Whatever praises may be given to works
of judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them to which the
invention must not contribute: as in the most regular gardens, art can
only reduce beauties of nature to more regularity, and such a figure,
which the common eye may better take in, and is, therefore, more
entertained with. And, perhaps, the reason why common critics are
inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and
fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue
their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art, than to
comprehend the vast and various extent of nature.</p>

<p>Our author's work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the
beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the
number of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery,
which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of
which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants,
each according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things
are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if
others are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only because
they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature.</p>

<p>It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute
that unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer, that no
man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him.
What he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thing
moves, every thing lives, and is put in action. If a council be called,
or a battle fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said<pb n="xxxii" /><anchor id="Pgxxxii" /> or
done as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by
the force of the poet's imagination, and turns in one place to a
hearer, in another to a spectator. The course of his verses resembles
that of the army he describes,</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hoid' ar' isan hosei te puri chthon pasa nemoito.</l>
</lg>

<p>"They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it." It
is, however, remarkable, that his fancy, which is everywhere vigorous,
is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its
fullest splendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and
others, and becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity.
Exact disposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers,
may have been found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this "vivida
vis animi," in a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect
or neglected, this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even
while we disapprove. Nay, where this appears, though attended with
absurdities, it brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing
but its own splendour. This fire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned
as through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than fierce, but
everywhere equal and constant: in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in
sudden, short, and interrupted flashes: In Milton it glows like a
furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art: in
Shakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental fire from
heaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burns everywhere clearly and
everywhere irresistibly.</p>

<p>I shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in
a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent
parts of his work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which
distinguishes him from all other authors.</p>

<p>This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the
violence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed
not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole
compass of nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward
passions and affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all
the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions: but
wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and
boundless walk for his imagination, and created a world for himself in
the invention of fable. That which Aristotle calls "the soul of
poetry," was first breathed into it by Homer, I shall begin with
considering him in his part, as it is naturally the first; and I speak
of it both as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken for
fiction.</p>

<p>Fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the
marvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as,
though they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature;
or of such as, though they did, became fables by the additional
episodes and manner of telling them. Of this sort is the main story of
an epic poem, "The return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in
Italy," or the like. That of the Iliad is the "anger of Achilles," the
most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet
this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents<pb n="xxxiii" /><anchor id="Pgxxxiii" /> and events, and
crowded with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and
episodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those poems whose
schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is
hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration
employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a
genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as
a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer's
poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The
other epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it
so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of
action, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor
is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his
invention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of
story. If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up
their forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus,
Virgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them)
destroys the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses
visit the shades, the Æneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent
after him. If he be detained from his return by the allurements of
Calypso, so is Æneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be
absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem,
Rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account. If he
gives his hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil and Tasso make the
same present to theirs. Virgil has not only observed this close
imitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the way, supplied the
want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon, and the taking
of Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word from
Pisander, as the loves of Dido and Æneas are taken from those of Medea
and Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.</p>

<p>To proceed to the allegorical fable—If we reflect upon those
innumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy
which Homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories,
what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us!
How fertile will that imagination appear, which as able to clothe all
the properties of elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues
and vices, in forms and persons, and to introduce them into actions
agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed! This is a field in
which no succeeding poets could dispute with Homer, and whatever
commendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means for
their invention in having enlarged his circle, but for their judgment
in having contracted it. For when the mode of learning changed in the
following ages, and science was delivered in a plainer manner, it then
became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside, as it
was in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was no unhappy
circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that demand
upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all
those allegorical parts of a poem.</p>

<p>The marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially
the machines of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced the
deities (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of<pb n="xxxiv" /><anchor id="Pgxxxiv" /> Greece, he seems
the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and
such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we find
those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods,
constantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support
of it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a
philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic,
that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have
been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set:
every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the
various changes of times and religions, his gods continue to this day
the gods of poetry.</p>

<p>We come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no
author has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a
variety, or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them.
Every one has something so singularly his own, that no painter could
have distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by
their manners. Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has
observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single
quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters
of the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and intractable; that of
Diomede forward, yet listening to advice, and subject to command; that
of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of Hector, active and vigilant:
the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition;
that of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people: we
find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in Sarpedon a gallant and
generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be
found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each
character, but even in the under parts of it, to which he takes care to
give a tincture of that principal one. For example: the main characters
of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this,
that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural,
open, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage; and
this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of
his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other
upon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these
kinds. The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open
manner; they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and,
where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to
those of Homer. His characters of valour are much alike; even that of
Turnus seems no way peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and
we see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of
Sergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest, In like manner it may be remarked of
Statius's heroes, that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; the
same horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus,
Hippomedon, &amp;c. They have a parity of character, which makes them seem
brothers of one family. I believe when the reader is led into this
tract of reflection, if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic
writers, he will be convinced how infinitely superior, in this point,
the invention of Homer was to that of all others.</p>

<pb n="xxxv" /><anchor id="xxxv" />

<p>The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters;
being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners,
of those who utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the
Iliad, so there is of speeches, than in any other poem. "Everything in
it has manner" (as Aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is
acted or spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how
small a number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the
dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches
often consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be
equally just in any person's mouth upon the same occasion. As many of
his persons have no apparent characters, so many of his speeches escape
being applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think of
the author himself when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in
Homer, all which are the effects of a colder invention, that interests
us less in the action described. Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil
leaves us readers.</p>

<p>If, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same
presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his
thoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part
Homer principally excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the
grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that they
have so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture. Duport, in his
Gnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this sort.
And it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if
Virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so
many that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom rises
into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the Iliad.</p>

<p>If we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the
invention still predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast
comprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance
of art, and individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and
fecundity of his imagination to which all things, in their various
views presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions
taken off to perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full
prospects of things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side
views, unobserved by any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as
the descriptions of his battles, which take up no less than half the
Iliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents, that no
one bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that
no two heroes are wounded in the same manner, and such a profusion of
noble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in greatness,
horror, and confusion. It is certain there is not near that number of
images and descriptions in any epic poet, though every one has assisted
himself with a great quantity out of him; and it is evident of Virgil
especially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from
his master.</p>

<p>If we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright
imagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We
acknowledge him the father of poetical diction; the first who taught
that "language of the gods" to men. His expression is like<pb n="xxxvi" /><anchor id="Pgxxxvi" /> the
colouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be laid on
boldly, and executed with rapidity. It is, indeed, the strongest and
most glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit.
Aristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who had found out
"living words;" there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than
in any good author whatever. An arrow is "impatient" to be on the wing,
a weapon "thirsts" to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like, yet
his expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in
proportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the
diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the
same degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter,
as that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass
in the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a
greater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the
heat more intense.</p>

<p>To throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected
the compound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper
to poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted
and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise
conduced in some measure to thicken the images. On this last
consideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of
his invention, since (as he has managed them) they are a sort of
supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were
joined. We see the motion of Hector's plumes in the epithet
Korythaiolos, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Einosiphyllos,
and so of others, which particular images could not have been insisted
upon so long as to express them in a description (though but of a
single line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal
action or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these
epithets is a short description.</p>

<p>Lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a
share of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not
satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of
Greece, but searched through its different dialects with this
particular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered
these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and
accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater
smoothness or strength. What he most affected was the Ionic, which has
a peculiar sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its
custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make
the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency.
With this he mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the
feebler Æolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its
accent, and completed this variety by altering some letters with the
licence of poetry. Thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his
sense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his
rapture, and even to give a further representation of his notions, in
the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified. Out of all
these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not
only the richest head, but the finest ear in the world. This is so
great a truth, that whoever will but<pb n="xxxvii" /><anchor id="Pgxxxvii" /> consult the tune of his verses,
even without understanding them (with the same sort of diligence as we
daily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will find more
sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language of
poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be
copied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to
ascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has some
advantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and
cadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language.
Virgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in
working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was
capable of, and, in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his
line to a beautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has
not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the
only reason is, that fewer critics have understood one language than
the other. Dionysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our
author's beauties in this kind, in his treatise of the Composition of
Words. It suffices at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow
with so much ease, as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than
to transcribe as fast as the Muses dictated, and, at the same time,
with so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise
us like the sound of a trumpet. They roll along as a plentiful river,
always in motion, and always full; while we are borne away by a tide of
verse, the most rapid, and yet the most smooth imaginable.</p>

<p>Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us
is his invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of
his work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more
extensive and copious than any other, his manners more lively and
strongly marked, his speeches more affecting and transported, his
sentiments more warm and sublime, his images and descriptions more full
and animated, his expression more raised and daring, and his numbers
more rapid and various. I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with
regard to any of these heads, I have no way derogated from his
character. Nothing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of
comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in
them, and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole.
We ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and
distinguishing excellence of each: it is in that we are to consider
him, and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him. No
author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty; and
as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in judgment. Not that
we are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because Virgil had it in a
more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, because Homer
possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors had more of
both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in
comparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the
better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work.
Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil
leads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generous
profusion;<pb n="xxxviii" /><anchor id="Pgxxxviii" /> Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like the
Nile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a
river in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold
their battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they
celebrate. Homer, boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all
before him, and shines more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil,
calmly daring, like Æneas, appears undisturbed in the midst of the
action; disposes all about him, and conquers with tranquillity. And
when we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his own Jupiter in
his terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the
heavens: Virgil, like the same power in his benevolence, counselling
with the gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his
whole creation.</p>

<p>But after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they
naturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to
distinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As
prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment
decline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or
extravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness. If we
look upon Homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief objections
against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this
faculty.</p>

<p>Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which
so much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of
probability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with
gigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength,
exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become
miracles in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit
something near extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable
performances. Thus Homer has his "speaking horses;" and Virgil his
"myrtles distilling blood;" where the latter has not so much as
contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability.</p>

<p>It is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have been
thought too exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of this
faculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability to confine
itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is
grounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images, which,
however, are so managed as not to overpower the main one. His similes
are like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its
proportion given agreeable to the original, but is also set off with
occasional ornaments and prospects. The same will account for his
manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when
his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent
images. The reader will easily extend this observation to more
objections of the same kind.</p>

<p>If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or
narrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will
be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the
times he lived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods;
and the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here<pb n="xxxix" /><anchor id="xxxix" />
speak a word of the latter, as it is a point generally carried into
extremes, both by the censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a
strange partiality to antiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,<note place="foot"><p>Preface to her Homer.</p></note>
"that those times and manners are so
much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours." Who can be
so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those ages,
when a spirit of revenge and cruelty, joined with the practice of
rapine and robbery, reigned through the world: when no mercy was shown
but for the sake of lucre; when the greatest princes were put to the
sword, and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines? On the
other side, I would not be so delicate as those modern critics, who are
shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we
sometimes see the heroes of Homer engaged. There is a pleasure in
taking a view of that simplicity, in opposition to the luxury of
succeeding ages: in beholding monarchs without their guards; princes
tending their flocks, and princesses drawing water from the springs.
When we read Homer, we ought to reflect that we are reading the most
ancient author in the heathen world; and those who consider him in this
light, will double their pleasure in the perusal of him. Let them think
they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no
more; that they are stepping almost three thousand years back into the
remotest antiquity, and entertaining themselves with a clear and
surprising vision of things nowhere else to be found, the only true
mirror of that ancient world. By this means alone their greatest
obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates their dislike, will
become a satisfaction.</p>

<p>This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of
the same epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the "far-darting
Phoebus," the "blue-eyed Pallas," the "swift-footed Achilles," &amp;c.,
which some have censured as impertinent, and tediously repeated. Those
of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to
belong to them; and had contracted a weight and veneration from the
rites and solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of
attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all
occasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit. As for the epithets
of great men, Mons. Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature
of surnames, and repeated as such; for the Greeks having no names
derived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinction
of each person; either naming his parents expressly, or his place of
birth, profession, or the like: as Alexander the son of Philip,
Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &amp;c. Homer, therefore,
complying with the custom of his country, used such distinctive
additions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we have something
parallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold
Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince,
&amp;c. If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for
the repetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the
world into its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the
brazen and the iron one, of "heroes distinct from other<pb n="xl" /><anchor id="Pgxl" /> men; a divine
race who fought at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by
the care of Jupiter in the islands of the blessed." Now among the
divine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in
common with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an
epithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their
families, actions or qualities.</p>

<p>What other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly
deserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the
course of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious
endeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should
think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation: one
would imagine, by the whole course of their parallels, that these
critics never so much as heard of Homer's having written first; a
consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have
always in his eye. Some accuse him for the same things which they
overlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the fable and
moral of the Æneis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which
might set the Odyssey above the Æneis; as that the hero is a wiser
man, and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that
of the other; or else they blame him for not doing what he never
designed; as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as
Æneas, when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character:
it is thus that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil.
Others select those particular passages of Homer which are not so
laboured as some that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole
management of Scaliger in his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they
take for low and mean expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy
and refinement, oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the
original, and then triumph in the awkwardness of their own
translations: this is the conduct of Perrault in his Parallels. Lastly,
there are others, who, pretending to a fairer proceeding, distinguish
between the personal merit of Homer, and that of his work; but when
they come to assign the causes of the great reputation of the Iliad,
they found it upon the ignorance of his times, and the prejudice of
those that followed: and in pursuance of this principle, they make
those accidents (such as the contention of the cities, &amp;c.) to be the
causes of his fame, which were in reality the consequences of his
merit. The same might as well be said of Virgil, or any great author
whose general character will infallibly raise many casual additions to
their reputation. This is the method of Mons. de la Mott; who yet
confesses upon the whole that in whatever age Homer had lived, he must
have been the greatest poet of his nation, and that he may be said in
his sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him.<note place="foot"><p>Hesiod. Opp. et Dier. Lib. I. vers. 155, &amp;c.</p></note></p>

<p>In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to
the honour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed
the characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his
followers, he still continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may
commit fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of
critics: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most<pb n="xli" /><anchor id="Pgxli" />
universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the
strongest enchantment. Homer not only appears the inventor of poetry,
but excels all the inventors of other arts, in this, that he has
swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him. What he has done
admitted no increase, it only left room for contraction or regulation.
He showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in
some of his flights, it was but because he attempted everything. A work
of this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from the most
vigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and produces the
finest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit
join to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults, have
only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of
nature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.</p>

<p>Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it
remains to treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief
characteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem,
such as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice
it but by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in
every particular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too
much softens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the
first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and
unmaimed; and for the rest, the diction and versification only are his
proper province, since these must be his own, but the others he is to
take as he finds them.</p>

<p>It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in
our language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no
literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior
language: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that
a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no
less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the
modern manners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there
is often a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a
version almost literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but
those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original,
and supporting the poetical style of the translation: and I will
venture to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by
a servile, dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours
by a chimerical, insolent hope of raising and improving their author.
It is not to be doubted, that the fire of the poem is what a translator
should principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his
managing: however, it is his safest way to be content with preserving
this to his utmost in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than
he finds his author is, in any particular place. It is a great secret
in writing, to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figurative;
and it is what Homer will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in
his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours
as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to
be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of
a mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer<pb n="xlii" /><anchor id="Pgxlii" /> seems to have been
more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of his
translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the
sublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of
simplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some
sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the
certain signs of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in
his train, while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an
unaffected and equal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes
one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be
envied for such commendations, as he may gain by that character of
style, which his friends must agree together to call simplicity, and
the rest of the world will call dulness. There is a graceful and
dignified simplicity, as well as a bold and sordid one; which differ as
much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven:
it is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all.
Simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity.</p>

<p>This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the
Scripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the
inspired writings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words
but what were intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that
part of the world; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his
style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books
than that of any other writer. This consideration (together with what
has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks,
induce a translator, on the one hand, to give in to several of those
general phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a
veneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament;
as, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the
Divinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.</p>

<p>For a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care
should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and
proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They have
something venerable, and as I may say, oracular, in that unadorned
gravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which
would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more
ingenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.</p>

<p>Perhaps the mixture of some Graecisms and old words after the manner of
Milton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill
effect in a version of this particular work, which most of any other
seems to require a venerable, antique cast. But certainly the use of
modern terms of war and government, such as "platoon, campaign, junto,"
or the like, (into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot be
allowable; those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat
the subjects in any living language.</p>

<p>There are two peculiarities in Homer's diction, which are a sort of
marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first
sight; those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as
defects, and those who are, seemed pleased with them as beauties. I
speak of his compound epithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the<pb n="xliii" /><anchor id="Pgxliii" />
former cannot be done literally into English without destroying the
purity of our language. I believe such should be retained as slide
easily of themselves into an English compound, without violence to the
ear or to the received rules of composition, as well as those which
have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets, and are
become familiar through their use of them; such as "the cloud-compelling
Jove," &amp;c. As for the rest, whenever any can be as fully and
significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded one, the
course to be taken is obvious.</p>

<p>Some that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one
or two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the
epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous
translated literally "leaf-shaking," but affords a majestic idea in the
periphrasis: "the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods." Others that
admit of different significations, may receive an advantage from a
judicious variation, according to the occasions on which they are
introduced. For example, the epithet of Apollo, hekaebolos or "far-shooting,"
is capable of two explications; one literal, in respect of
the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the other allegorical, with
regard to the rays of the sun; therefore, in such places where Apollo
is represented as a god in person, I would use the former
interpretation; and where the effects of the sun are described, I would
make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be necessary to
avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in
Homer, and which, though it might be accommodated (as has been already
shown) to the ear of those times, is by no means so to ours: but one
may wait for opportunities of placing them, where they derive an
additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed; and in
doing this properly, a translator may at once show his fancy and his
judgment.</p>

<p>As for Homer's repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of
whole narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or
hemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these,
as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor
to offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not
ungraceful in those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders
it a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods
to men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or
where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it, in the solemn
forms of prayers, oaths, or the like. In other cases, I believe the
best rule is, to be guided by the nearness, or distance, at which the
repetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close, one
may vary the expression; but it is a question, whether a professed
translator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious, the author is
to answer for it.</p>

<p>It only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said)
is perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every
new subject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of
poetry, and attainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for it
in the Greek, and Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what may
sometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully<pb n="xliv" /><anchor id="Pgxliv" /> possessed
of his image: however, it may reasonably be believed they designed
this, in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to
all others. Few readers have the ear to be judges of it: but those who
have, will see I have endeavoured at this beauty.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing
justice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may
entertain without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him
than any entire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those
of Chapman, Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an
immeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce
any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent
interpolations of four or six lines; and I remember one in the
thirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty
verses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one
might think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other places of
his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had a
strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author;
insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of the mysteries
he had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the
obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in fustian; a
fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the
tragedy of Bussy d'Amboise, &amp;c. In a word, the nature of the man may
account for his whole performance; for he appears, from his preface and
remarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in poetry.
His own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less than fifteen
weeks, shows with what negligence his version was performed. But that
which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover
his defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation,
which is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have
writ before he arrived at years of discretion.</p>

<p>Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but
for particulars and circumstances he continually lops them, and often
omits the most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close
translation, I doubt not many have been led into that error by the
shortness of it, which proceeds not from his following the original
line by line, but from the contractions above mentioned. He sometimes
omits whole similes and sentences; and is now and then guilty of
mistakes, into which no writer of his learning could have fallen, but
through carelessness. His poetry, as well as Ogilby's, is too mean for
criticism.</p>

<p>It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live
to translate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book, and a small
part of the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly
interpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be
excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to
have had too much regard to Chapman, whose words he sometimes copies,
and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the
original. However, had he translated the whole work, I would no more
have attempted Homer after him than Virgil: his version of whom
(notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spirited
translation I know in any language. But the fate of great geniuses is
like<pb n="xlv" /><anchor id="Pgxlv" /> that of great ministers: though they are confessedly the first in
the commonwealth of letters, they must be envied and calumniated only
for being at the head of it.</p>

<p>That which, in my opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one who
translates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and
fire which makes his chief character: in particular places, where the
sense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as
most agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of
his style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve,
in the more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the
more sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a
fulness and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not
to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor
sometimes the very cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound
any rites or customs of antiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the
whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any
translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry. What
I would further recommend to him is, to study his author rather from
his own text, than from any commentaries, how learned soever, or
whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world; to
consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the
ancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these, the
Archbishop of Cambray's Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the
spirit and turn of our author; and Bossu's admirable Treatise of the
Epic Poem the justest notion of his design and conduct. But after all,
with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever
happiness he may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few;
those only who have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning.
For to satisfy such a want either, is not in the nature of this
undertaking; since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not
modern, and a pedant nothing that is not Greek.</p>

<p>What I have done is submitted to the public; from whose opinions I am
prepared to learn; though I fear no judges so little as our best poets,
who are most sensible of the weight of this task. As for the worst,
whatever they shall please to say, they may give me some concern as
they are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers. I was
guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and
by persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be
true, that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men
of wit. Mr. Addison was the first whose advice determined me to
undertake this task; who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion
in such terms as I cannot repeat without vanity. I was obliged to Sir
Richard Steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the
public. Dr. Swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he
always serves his friend. The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel
Garth are what I never knew wanting on any occasion. I must also
acknowledge, with infinite pleasure, the many friendly offices, as well
as sincere criticisms, of Mr. Congreve, who had led me the way in
translating some parts of Homer. I must add the names of Mr. Rowe, and
Dr. Parnell, though I shall take a further opportunity of doing justice
to the last, whose good nature (to<pb n="xlvi" /><anchor id="Pgxlvi" /> give it a great panegyric), is no
less extensive than his learning. The favour of these gentlemen is not
entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection. But
what can I say of the honour so many of the great have done me; while
the first names of the age appear as my subscribers, and the most
distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief
encouragers? Among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find,
that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to
the name of poet: that his grace the Duke of Buckingham was not
displeased I should undertake the author to whom he has given (in his
excellent Essay), so complete a praise:</p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Homer will be all the books you need."</l>
</lg>

<p>That the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me; of whom it
is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing
to his generosity or his example: that such a genius as my Lord
Bolingbroke, not more distinguished in the great scenes of business,
than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning, has not
refused to be the critic of these sheets, and the patron of their
writer: and that the noble author of the tragedy of "Heroic Love" has
continued his partiality to me, from my writing pastorals to my
attempting the Iliad. I cannot deny myself the pride of confessing,
that I have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct
in general, but their correction of several particulars of this
translation.</p>

<p>I could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the
Earl of Carnarvon; but it is almost absurd to particularize any one
generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of
them. Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary of state, will pardon my
desire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair.
The particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late Lord
Chancellor) gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his
friendship. I must attribute to the same motive that of several others
of my friends: to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by
the privileges of a familiar correspondence; and I am satisfied I can
no way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence.</p>

<p>In short, I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. He would
have thought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens that
has been shown me by its learned rival, the University of Oxford. And I
can hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death, when
I reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy
friendships, which make the satisfaction of life. This distinction is
the more to be acknowledged, as it is shown to one whose pen has never
gratified the prejudices of particular parties, or the vanities of
particular men. Whatever the success may prove, I shall never repent of
an undertaking in which I have experienced the candour and friendship
of so many persons of merit; and in which I hope to pass some of those
years of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies, after a
manner neither wholly unuseful to others, nor disagreeable to myself.</p>

<p>ARGUMENT.<note place="foot"><p>The following argument of the Iliad, corrected in
a few particulars, is translated from Bitaube, and is, perhaps, the
neatest summary that has ever been drawn up:—"A hero, injured by his
general, and animated with a noble resentment, retires to his tent; and
for a season withdraws himself and his troops from the war. During this
interval, victory abandons the army, which for nine years has been
occupied in a great enterprise, upon the successful termination of
which the honour of their country depends. The general, at length
opening his eyes to the fault which he had committed, deputes the
principal officers of his army to the incensed hero, with commission to
make compensation for the injury, and to tender magnificent presents.
The hero, according to the proud obstinacy of his character, persists
in his animosity; the army is again defeated, and is on the verge of
entire destruction. This inexorable man has a friend; this friend weeps
before him, and asks for the hero's arms, and for permission to go to
the war in his stead. The eloquence of friendship prevails more than
the intercession of the ambassadors or the gifts of the general. He
lends his armour to his friend, but commands him not to engage with the
chief of the enemy's army, because he reserves to himself the honour of
that combat, and because he also fears for his friend's life. The
prohibition is forgotten; the friend listens to nothing but his
courage; his corpse is brought back to the hero, and the hero's arms
become the prize of the conqueror. Then the hero, given up to the most
lively despair, prepares to fight; he receives from a divinity new
armour, is reconciled with his general and, thirsting for glory and
revenge, enacts prodigies of valour, recovers the victory, slays the
enemy's chief, honours his friend with superb funeral rites, and
exercises a cruel vengeance on the body of his destroyer; but finally
appeased by the tears and prayers of the father of the slain warrior,
restores to the old man the corpse of his son, which he buries with due
solemnities.'—Coleridge, p. 177, sqq.</p></note></p>

<p>THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.</p>

<p>In the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring
towns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseis and
Briseis, allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles.
Chryses, the father of Chryseis, and priest of Apollo, comes to the
Grecian camp to ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in
the tenth year of the siege. The priest being refused, and insolently
dismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who
inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and
encourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the
refusal of Chryseis. The king, being obliged to send back his captive,
enters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies;
however, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on
Briseis in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his
forces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she
supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her
son, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter, granting her suit,
incenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till they are
reconciled by the address of Vulcan.</p>

<p>The time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine during
the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes, and twelve
for Jupiter's stay with the Æthiopians, at whose return Thetis prefers
her petition. The scene lies in the Grecian camp, then changes to
Chrysa, and lastly to Olympus.</p>

of their baggage, and thongs of their armour. In fulfilment of the

Apollo. Grote, "History of Greece," i. p. 68, remarks that the "worship

in mind, is a different character from the deity of the same name

unforeseen or invisible causes, the ravages of pestilence, the fate of
the young child or promising adult, cut off in the germ of infancy or
flower of youth, of the old man dropping peacefully into the grave, or
of the reckless sinner suddenly checked in his career of crime, are
ascribed to the arrows of Apollo or Diana. The oracular functions of
the god rose naturally out of the above fundamental attributes, for who
could more appropriately impart to mortals what little foreknowledge
Fate permitted of her decrees than the agent of her most awful
dispensations? The close union of the arts of prophecy and song
explains his additional office of god of music, while the arrows with
which he and his sister were armed, symbols of sudden death in every
age, no less naturally procured him that of god of archery. Of any
connection between Apollo and the Sun, whatever may have existed in the
more esoteric doctrine of the Greek sanctuaries, there is no trace in

<l rend="margin-left: 2">A maid, unmatch'd in manners as in face,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prize, the beauteous prize, I will resign,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So dearly valued, and so justly mine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But since for common good I yield the fair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My private loss let grateful Greece repair;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor unrewarded let your prince complain,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Insatiate king (Achilles thus replies),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fond of the power, but fonder of the prize!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Would'st thou the Greeks their lawful prey should yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The due reward of many a well-fought field?</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spoils of cities razed and warriors slain,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">(That trick of tyrants) may be borne by slaves.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet if our chief for plunder only fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spoils of Ilion shall thy loss requite,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus the king: "Shall I my prize resign</l>

them were indefatigable, continually employed in cultivating the earth;
the change from ants to men is founded merely on the equivocation of
their name, which resembles that of the ant: they bore a further
resemblance to these little animals, in that instead of inhabiting
towns or villages, at first they commonly resided in the open fields,
having no other retreats but dens and the cavities of trees, until
Ithacus brought them together, and settled them in more secure and
comfortable habitations."—Anthon's "Lempriere."</p></note></l>

Achilles, unseen by the rest, was intended to point out the sudden
recollection that he would gain nothing by intemperate wrath, and that
it were best to restrain his anger, and only gratify it by withdrawing
his services. The same idea is rather cleverly worked out by Apuleius,

great difficulty, succeeded in obtaining her hand, as she eluded him by
assuming various forms. Her children were all destroyed by fire through
her attempts to see whether they were immortal, and Achilles would have
shared the same fate had not his father rescued him. She afterwards

sacred ship so often represented on Egyptian monuments, and the return
of the deity from Ethiopia after some days' absence, serves to show the
Ethiopian origin of Thebes, and of the worship of Jupiter Ammon. "I
think," says Heeren, after quoting a passage from Diodorus about the
holy ship, "that this procession is represented in one of the great
sculptured reliefs on the temple of Karnak. The sacred ship of Ammon is
on the shore with its whole equipment, and is towed along by another
boat. It is therefore on its voyage. This must have been one of the
most celebrated festivals, since, even according to the interpretation
of antiquity, Homer alludes to it when he speaks of Jupiter's visit to
the Ethiopians, and his twelve days' absence."—Long, "Egyptian
Antiquities" vol. 1 p. 96. Eustathius, vol. 1 p. 98, sq. (ed. Basil)
gives this interpretation, and likewise an allegorical one, which we
will spare the reader.</p></note></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">At this, the sire embraced the maid again,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thus with arms devoutly raised in air,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"God of the silver bow, thy ear incline,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Between their horns the salted barley threw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, with their heads to heaven, the victims slew:<note place="foot"><p>That is, drawing back their necks while they cut their

that the genius of Homer had inspired him with it. Those who beheld
this statue are said to have been so struck with it as to have asked

a sleep, to prevent him aiding his son. Jove, in revenge, fastened iron
anvils to her feet, and hung her from the sky, and Vulcan, attempting
to relieve her, was kicked down from Olympus in the manner described.
The allegorists have gone mad in finding deep explanations for this
amusing fiction. See Heraclides, 'Ponticus," p. 463 sq., ed Gale. The
story is told by Homer himself in Book xv. The Sinthians were a race of

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE TRIAL OF THE ARMY, AND CATALOGUE OF THE FORCES.</p>

<p>Jupiter, in pursuance of the request of Thetis, sends a deceitful
vision to Agamemnon, persuading him to lead the army to battle, in
order to make the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles. The
general, who is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy without his
assistance, but fears the army was discouraged by his absence, and the
late plague, as well as by the length of time, contrives to make trial
of their disposition by a stratagem. He first communicates his design
to the princes in council, that he would propose a return to the
soldiers, and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal
was embraced. Then he assembles the whole host, and upon moving for a
return to Greece, they unanimously agree to it, and run to prepare the
ships. They are detained by the management of Ulysses, who chastises
the insolence of Thersites. The assembly is recalled, several speeches
made on the occasion, and at length the advice of Nestor followed,
which was to make a general muster of the troops, and to divide them
into their several nations, before they proceeded to battle. This gives
occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the Greeks and
Trojans, and in a large catalogue.</p>

<p>The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day. The
scene lies in the Grecian camp, and upon the sea-shore; towards the end
it removes to Troy.</p>


<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now pleasing sleep had seal'd each mortal eye,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The immortals slumber'd on their thrones above;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.<note place="foot"><p>Plato, Rep. iii. p. 437, was so scandalized at this
deception of Jupiter's, and at his other attacks on the character of
the gods, that he would fain sentence him to an honourable banishment.
(See Minucius Felix, Section 22.) Coleridge, Introd. p. 154, well
observes, that the supreme father of gods and men had a full right to
employ a lying spirit to work out his ultimate will. Compare "Paradise
Lost," v. 646:</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">"And roseate dews disposed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest."</l>
</lg></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To honour Thetis' son he bends his care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus commands the vision of the night.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Fly hence, deluding Dream! and light as air,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Dream</hi> ought to be spelt with a capital letter, being,
I think, evidently personified as the god of dreams. See Anthon and

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce from his seat at this Ulysses springs,<note place="foot"><p>It may be remarked, that the character of Thersites,
revolting and contemptible as it is, serves admirably to develop the
disposition of Ulysses in a new light, in which mere cunning is less
prominent. Of the gradual and individual development of Homer's heroes,
Schlegel well observes, "In bas-relief the figures are usually in
profile, and in the epos all are characterized in the simplest manner
in relief; they are not grouped together, but follow one another; so
Homer's heroes advance, one by one, in succession before us. It has
been remarked that the <hi rend="font-style: italic">Iliad</hi> is not definitively closed, but
that we are left to suppose something both to precede and to follow it.
The bas-relief is equally without limit, and may be continued <hi rend="font-style: italic">ad
infinitum,</hi> either from before or behind, on which account the
ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of an indefinite
extension, sacrificial processions, dances, and lines of combatants,
and hence they also exhibit bas-reliefs on curved surfaces, such as
vases, or the frieze of a rotunda, where, by the curvature, the two
ends are withdrawn from our sight, and where, while we advance, one
object appears as another disappears. Reading Homer is very much like
such a circuit; the present object alone arresting our attention, we
lose sight of what precedes, and do not concern ourselves about what is
to follow."—"Dramatic Literature," p. 75.</p></note></l>

awaits a presumptuous critic, even where his virulent reproaches are
substantially well-founded, is plainly set forth in the treatment of
Thersites; while the unpopularity of such a character is attested even
more by the excessive pains which Homer takes to heap upon him
repulsive personal deformities, than by the chastisement of Odysseus

"Particular animals were, at a later time, consecrated to particular
deities. To Jupiter, Ceres, Juno, Apollo, and Bacchus victims of
advanced age might be offered. An ox of five years old was considered
especially acceptable to Jupiter. A black bull, a ram, or a boar pig,
were offerings for Neptune. A heifer, or a sheep, for Minerva. To Ceres
a sow was sacrificed, as an enemy to corn. The goat to Bacchus, because
he fed on vines. Diana was propitiated with a stag; and to Venus the
dove was consecrated. The infernal and evil deities were to be appeased
with black victims. The most acceptable of all sacrifices was the
heifer of a year old, which had never borne the yoke. It was to be
perfect in every limb, healthy, and without blemish."—"Elgin Marbles,"

rising, according to Strabo, on the highest part of Mount Ida, in the
same hill with the Granicus and the OEdipus, and falling into the sea
at Sigaeum; everything tends to identify it with Mendere, as Wood,
Rennell, and others maintain; the Mendere is 40 miles long, 300 feet
broad, deep in the time of flood, nearly dry in the summer. Dr. Clarke
successfully combats the opinion of those who make the Scamander to
have arisen from the springs of Bounabarshy, and traces the source of
the river to the highest mountain in the chain of Ida, now Kusdaghy;
receives the Simois in its course; towards its mouth it is very muddy,
and flows through marshes. Between the Scamander and Simois, Homer's
Troy is supposed to have stood: this river, according to Homer, was
called Xanthus by the gods, Scamander by men. The waters of the
Scamander had the singular property of giving a beautiful colour to the
hair or wool of such animals as bathed in them; hence the three
goddesses, Minerva, Juno, and Venus, bathed there before they appeared
before Paris to obtain the golden apple: the name Xanthus, "yellow,"
was given to the Scamander, from the peculiar colour of its waters,
still applicable to the Mendere, the yellow colour of whose waters
attracts the attention of travellers.</p></note></l>

<p rend="text-align: center">THE CATALOGUE OF THE SHIPS.<note place="foot"><p>"The Catalogue is, perhaps, the
portion of the poem in favour of which a claim to separate authorship
has been most plausibly urged. Although the example of Homer has since
rendered some such formal enumeration of the forces engaged, a common
practice in epic poems descriptive of great warlike adventures, still
so minute a statistical detail can neither be considered as
imperatively required, nor perhaps such as would, in ordinary cases,
suggest itself to the mind of a poet. Yet there is scarcely any portion
of the Iliad where both historical and internal evidence are more
clearly in favour of a connection from the remotest period, with the
remainder of the work. The composition of the Catalogue, whensoever it
may have taken place, necessarily presumes its author's acquaintance
with a previously existing Iliad. It were impossible otherwise to
account for the harmony observable in the recurrence of so vast a
number of proper names, most of them historically unimportant, and not
a few altogether fictitious: or of so many geographical and
genealogical details as are condensed in these few hundred lines, and
incidentally scattered over the thousands which follow: equally
inexplicable were the pointed allusions occurring in this episode to
events narrated in the previous and subsequent text, several of which
could hardly be of traditional notoriety, but through the medium of the
Iliad."—Mure, "Language and Literature of Greece," vol. i. p. 263.</p></note></p>

vessels, which carried one hundred and twenty men each, were probably
meant to be the largest in the fleet, and those of Philoctetes,
carrying fifty each, the smallest. The average would be eighty-five,
and Thucydides supposes the troops to have rowed and navigated
themselves; and that very few, besides the chiefs, went as mere
passengers or landsmen. In short, we have in the Homeric descriptions
the complete picture of an Indian or African war canoe, many of
which are considerably larger than the largest scale assigned to those
of the Greeks. If the total number of the Greek ships be taken at
twelve hundred, according to Thucydides, although in point of fact
there are only eleven hundred and eighty-six in the Catalogue, the
amount of the army, upon the foregoing average, will be about a hundred
and two thousand men. The historian considers this a small force as
representing all Greece. Bryant, comparing it with the allied army at
Platae, thinks it so large as to prove the entire falsehood of the
whole story; and his reasonings and calculations are, for their
curiosity, well worth a careful perusal."—Coleridge, p. 211, sq.</p></note></l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE DUEL OF MENELAUS AND PARIS.</p>

<p>The armies being ready to engage, a single combat is agreed upon
between Menelaus and Paris (by the intervention of Hector) for the
determination of the war. Iris is sent to call Helen to behold the
fight. She leads her to the walls of Troy, where Priam sat with his
counsellers observing the Grecian leaders on the plain below, to whom
Helen gives an account of the chief of them. The kings on either part
take the solemn oath for the conditions of the combat. The duel ensues;
wherein Paris being overcome, he is snatched away in a cloud by Venus,
and transported to his apartment. She then calls Helen from the walls,
and brings the lovers together. Agamemnon, on the part of the Grecians,
demands the restoration of Helen, and the performance of the articles.</p>

<p>The three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book. The
scene is sometimes in the fields before Troy, and sometimes in Troy
itself.</p>


<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus by their leaders' care each martial band</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Moves into ranks, and stretches o'er the land.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proclaim their motions, and provoke the war</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So when inclement winters vex the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,<note place="foot"><lg>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now front to front the hostile armies stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eager of fight, and only wait command;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dared the bravest of the Grecian race.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He boldly stalk'd, the foremost on the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him Menelaus, loved of Mars, espies,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eager he seizes and devours the slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Press'd by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In clanging arms he leaps upon the ground</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his high chariot: him, approaching near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The beauteous champion views with marks of fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Smit with a conscious sense, retires behind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And shuns the fate he well deserved to find.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His silence here, with blushes, Paris breaks:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"'Tis just, my brother, what your anger speaks:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But who like thee can boast a soul sedate,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy force, like steel, a temper'd hardness shows,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">With falling woods to strew the wasted plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy gifts I praise; nor thou despise the charms</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With which a lover golden Venus arms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soft moving speech, and pleasing outward show,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No wish can gain them, but the gods bestow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet, would'st thou have the proffer'd combat stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then let a midway space our hosts divide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, on that stage of war, the cause be tried:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Paris there the Spartan king be fought,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For beauteous Helen and the wealth she brought;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And who his rival can in arms subdue,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said. The challenge Hector heard with joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Held by the midst, athwart; and near the foe</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Advanced with steps majestically slow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While round his dauntless head the Grecians pour</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their stones and arrows in a mingled shower.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus the monarch, great Atrides, cried:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Forbear, ye warriors! lay the darts aside:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A parley Hector asks, a message bears;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">We know him by the various plume he wears."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Awed by his high command the Greeks attend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The tumult silence, and the fight suspend.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While from the centre Hector rolls his eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On either host, and thus to both applies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What Paris, author of the war, demands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your shining swords within the sheath restrain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pitch your lances in the yielding plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here in the midst, in either army's sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He dares the Spartan king to single fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wills that Helen and the ravish'd spoil,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That caused the contest, shall reward the toil.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let these the brave triumphant victor grace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And different nations part in leagues of peace."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke: in still suspense on either side</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each army stood: the Spartan chief replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A world engages in the toils of fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To me the labour of the field resign;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Me Paris injured; all the war be mine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fall he that must, beneath his rival's arms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And live the rest, secure of future harms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two lambs, devoted by your country's rite,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let reverend Priam in the truce engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And add the sanction of considerate age;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His sons are faithless, headlong in debate,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The nations hear with rising hopes possess'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And peaceful prospects dawn in every breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Within the lines they drew their steeds around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from their chariots issued on the ground;</l>
<pb n="055" /><anchor id="Pg055" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next, all unbuckling the rich mail they wore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Laid their bright arms along the sable shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On either side the meeting hosts are seen</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With lances fix'd, and close the space between.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two heralds now, despatch'd to Troy, invite</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime to beauteous Helen, from the skies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The various goddess of the rainbow flies:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her in the palace, at her loom she found;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The golden web her own sad story crown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojan wars she weaved (herself the prize)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the goddess of the painted bow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Approach, and view the wondrous scene below!<note place="foot"><p>The following scene, in which Homer has contrived to
introduce so brilliant a sketch of the Grecian warriors, has been
imitated by Euripides, who in his "Phoenissae" represents Antigone

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each hardy Greek, and valiant Trojan knight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So dreadful late, and furious for the fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now rest their spears, or lean upon their shields;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ceased is the war, and silent all the fields.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Paris alone and Sparta's king advance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In single fight to toss the beamy lance;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each met in arms, the fate of combat tries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy love the motive, and thy charms the prize."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, the many-coloured maid inspires</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her country, parents, all that once were dear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rush to her thought, and force a tender tear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er her fair face a snowy veil she threw,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her handmaids, Clymene and Æthra, wait</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her silent footsteps to the Scaean gate.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There sat the seniors of the Trojan race:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Old Priam's chiefs, and most in Priam's grace,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king the first; Thymoetes at his side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lampus and Clytius, long in council tried;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Panthus, and Hicetaon, once the strong;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And next, the wisest of the reverend throng,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antenor grave, and sage Ucalegon,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">A bloodless race, that send a feeble voice.</l>
<pb n="056" /><anchor id="Pg056" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These, when the Spartan queen approach'd the tower,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In secret own'd resistless beauty's power:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They cried, "No wonder such celestial charms<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">No wonder,</hi> &amp;c. Zeuxis, the celebrated artist, is said

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from destruction save the Trojan race."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The good old Priam welcomed her, and cried,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Approach, my child, and grace thy father's side.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">See on the plain thy Grecian spouse appears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The friends and kindred of thy former years.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No crime of thine our present sufferings draws,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not thou, but Heaven's disposing will, the cause</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gods these armies and this force employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hostile gods conspire the fate of Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But lift thy eyes, and say, what Greek is he</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Far as from hence these aged orbs can see)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around whose brow such martial graces shine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So tall, so awful, and almost divine!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though some of larger stature tread the green,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">None match his grandeur and exalted mien:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He seems a monarch, and his country's pride."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus ceased the king, and thus the fair replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Before thy presence, father, I appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With conscious shame and reverential fear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah! had I died, ere to these walk I fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">False to my country, and my nuptial bed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My brothers, friends, and daughter left behind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">False to them all, to Paris only kind!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For this I mourn, till grief or dire disease</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall waste the form whose fault it was to please!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king of kings, Atrides, you survey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great in the war, and great in arts of sway:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My brother once, before my days of shame!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And oh! that still he bore a brother's name!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With wonder Priam view'd the godlike man,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Extoll'd the happy prince, and thus began:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O bless'd Atrides! born to prosperous fate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Successful monarch of a mighty state!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How vast thy empire! Of your matchless train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What numbers lost, what numbers yet remain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In Phrygia once were gallant armies known,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In ancient time, when Otreus fill'd the throne,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When godlike Mygdon led their troops of horse,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And I, to join them, raised the Trojan force:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against the manlike Amazons we stood,<note place="foot"><p>The early epic was largely occupied with the exploits and
sufferings of women, or heroines, the wives and daughters of the
Grecian heroes. A nation of courageous, hardy, indefatigable women,
dwelling apart from men, permitting only a short temporary intercourse,
for the purpose of renovating their numbers, burning out their right
breast with a view of enabling themselves to draw the bow freely; this
was at once a general type, stimulating to the fancy of the poet, and a
theme eminently popular with his hearers. We find these warlike females
constantly reappearing in the ancient poems, and universally accepted
as past realities in the Iliad. When Priam wishes to illustrate
emphatically the most numerous host in which he ever found himself
included, he tells us that it was assembled in Phrygia, on the banks of
the Sangarius, for the purpose of resisting the formidable Amazons.
When Bellerophon is to be employed in a deadly and perilous
undertaking, by those who prudently wished to procure his death, he is
despatched against the Amazons.—Grote, vol. i p. 289.</p></note></l>
<pb n="057" /><anchor id="Pg057" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Sangar's stream ran purple with their blood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But far inferior those, in martial grace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And strength of numbers, to this Grecian race."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, once more he view'd the warrior train;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What's he, whose arms lie scatter'd on the plain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Broad is his breast, his shoulders larger spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though great Atrides overtops his head.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor yet appear his care and conduct small;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From rank to rank he moves, and orders all.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stately ram thus measures o'er the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, master of the flock, surveys them round."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Helen thus: "Whom your discerning eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Have singled out, is Ithacus the wise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A barren island boasts his glorious birth;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Myself, O king! have seen that wondrous man</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To seal the truce, and end the dire debate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Paris, thy son, and Sparta's king advance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In measured lists to toss the weighty lance;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus with a lasting league our toils may cease,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With grief he heard, and bade the chiefs prepare</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To join his milk-white coursers to the car;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He mounts the seat, Antenor at his side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gentle steeds through Scaea's gates they guide:<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Scaea's gates,</hi> rather <hi rend="font-style: italic">Scaean gates,</hi>
<hi rend="font-style: italic">i.e.</hi> the left-hand gates.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next from the car descending on the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amid the Grecian host and Trojan train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Slow they proceed: the sage Ulysses then</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arose, and with him rose the king of men.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On either side a sacred herald stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wine they mix, and on each monarch's hands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pour the full urn; then draws the Grecian lord</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the sign'd victims crops the curling hair;<note place="foot"><p>This was customary in all sacrifices. Hence we find Iras
descending to cut off the hair of Dido, before which she could not
expire.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The heralds part it, and the princes share;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then loudly thus before the attentive bands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He calls the gods, and spreads his lifted hands:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O first and greatest power! whom all obey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who high on Ida's holy mountain sway,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eternal Jove! and you bright orb that roll</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From east to west, and view from pole to pole!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou mother Earth! and all ye living floods!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Infernal furies, and Tartarean gods,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hear, and be witness. If, by Paris slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Menelaus press the fatal plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dame and treasures let the Trojan keep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Greece returning plough the watery deep.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If by my brother's lance the Trojan bleed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The appointed fine let Ilion justly pay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And every age record the signal day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This if the Phrygians shall refuse to yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arms must revenge, and Mars decide the field."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With that the chief the tender victims slew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in the dust their bleeding bodies threw;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The vital spirit issued at the wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And left the members quivering on the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the same urn they drink the mingled wine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And add libations to the powers divine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thus their prayers united mount the sky,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hear, mighty Jove! and hear, ye gods on high!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And may their blood, who first the league confound,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shed like this wine, disdain the thirsty ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">May all their consorts serve promiscuous lust,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all their lust be scatter'd as the dust!"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus either host their imprecations join'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which Jove refused, and mingled with the wind.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rites now finish'd, reverend Priam rose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus express'd a heart o'ercharged with woes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye Greeks and Trojans, let the chiefs engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But spare the weakness of my feeble age:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In yonder walls that object let me shun,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor view the danger of so dear a son.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaven only knows; for heaven disposes all."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, the hoary king no longer stay'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But on his car the slaughter'd victims laid:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And drove to Troy, Antenor at his side.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bold Hector and Ulysses now dispose</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lists of combat, and the ground inclose:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next to decide, by sacred lots prepare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who first shall launch his pointed spear in air.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The people pray with elevated hands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And words like these are heard through all the bands:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Immortal Jove, high Heaven's superior lord,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On lofty Ida's holy mount adored!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whoe'er involved us in this dire debate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O give that author of the war to fate</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And shades eternal! let division cease,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And joyful nations join in leagues of peace."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With eyes averted Hector hastes to turn</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, Paris, thine leap'd forth; by fatal chance</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ordain'd the first to whirl the weighty lance.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Both armies sat the combat to survey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beside each chief his azure armour lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And round the lists the generous coursers neigh.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The beauteous warrior now arrays for fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In gilded arms magnificently bright:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The purple cuishes clasp his thighs around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With flowers adorn'd, with silver buckles bound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lycaon's corslet his fair body dress'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Braced in and fitted to his softer breast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His youthful face a polish'd helm o'erspread;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The waving horse-hair nodded on his head:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His figured shield, a shining orb, he takes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in his hand a pointed javelin shakes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With equal speed and fired by equal charms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Spartan hero sheathes his limbs in arms.</l>
</lg>

<pb n="061" /><anchor id="Pg061" />

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now round the lists the admiring armies stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With javelins fix'd, the Greek and Trojan band.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amidst the dreadful vale, the chiefs advance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All pale with rage, and shake the threatening lance.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojan first his shining javelin threw;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on Atrides' ringing shield it flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor pierced the brazen orb, but with a bound<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Nor pierced.</hi></p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"This said, his feeble hand a jav'lin threw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which, flutt'ring, seemed to loiter as it flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Just, and but barely, to the mark it held,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield."</l>
</lg>

<p rend="text-align: right">Dryden's Virgil, ii. 742.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Leap'd from the buckler, blunted, on the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Atrides then his massy lance prepares,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In act to throw, but first prefers his prayers:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Give me, great Jove! to punish lawless lust,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lay the Trojan gasping in the dust:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Destroy the aggressor, aid my righteous cause,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Avenge the breach of hospitable laws!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let this example future times reclaim,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And guard from wrong fair friendship's holy name."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be said, and poised in air the javelin sent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through Paris' shield the forceful weapon went,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His corslet pierces, and his garment rends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And glancing downward, near his flank descends.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wary Trojan, bending from the blow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eludes the death, and disappoints his foe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But fierce Atrides waved his sword, and strook</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on his casque: the crested helmet shook;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brittle steel, unfaithful to his hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Broke short: the fragments glitter'd on the sand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The raging warrior to the spacious skies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Raised his upbraiding voice and angry eyes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Then is it vain in Jove himself to trust?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And is it thus the gods assist the just?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When crimes provoke us, Heaven success denies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dart falls harmless, and the falchion flies."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Furious he said, and towards the Grecian crew</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Seized by the crest) the unhappy warrior drew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struggling he followed, while the embroider'd thong</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That tied his helmet, dragg'd the chief along.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then had his ruin crown'd Atrides' joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Venus trembled for the prince of Troy:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unseen she came, and burst the golden band;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And left an empty helmet in his hand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The casque, enraged, amidst the Greeks he threw;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks with smiles the polish'd trophy view.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, as once more he lifts the deadly dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In thirst of vengeance, at his rival's heart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The queen of love her favour'd champion shrouds</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE BREACH OF THE TRUCE, AND THE FIRST BATTLE.</p>

<p>The gods deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war: they agree
upon the continuation of it, and Jupiter sends down Minerva to break
the truce. She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus, who is
wounded, but cured by Machaon. In the meantime some of the Trojan
troops attack the Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts
of a good general; he reviews the troops, and exhorts the leaders, some
by praises and others by reproof. Nestor is particularly celebrated for
his military discipline. The battle joins, and great numbers are slain
on both sides.</p>

<p>The same day continues through this as through the last book (as it
does also through the two following, and almost to the end of the
seventh book). The scene is wholly in the field before Troy.</p>


<lg>

originally a god, or whether he was first a man and then became
afterwards a god; but Apollodorus professed to fix the exact date of
his apotheosis. Throughout all the historical ages the descendants of
Asklepius were numerous and widely diffused. The many families or
gentes, called Asklepiads, who devoted themselves to the study and
practice of medicine, and who principally dwelt near the temples of
Asklepius, whither sick and suffering men came to obtain relief—all
recognized the god not merely as the object of their common worship,

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or press'd the car with polish'd brass inlaid</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But left Eurymedon the reins to guide;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fiery coursers snorted at his side.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On foot through all the martial ranks he moves</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And these encourages, and those reproves.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Brave men!" he cries, (to such who boldly dare</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Urge their swift steeds to face the coming war),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Your ancient valour on the foes approve;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove is with Greece, and let us trust in Jove.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis not for us, but guilty Troy, to dread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her sons and matrons Greece shall lead in chains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And her dead warriors strew the mournful plains."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus with new ardour he the brave inspires;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or thus the fearful with reproaches fires:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Shame to your country, scandal of your kind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Born to the fate ye well deserve to find!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prepared for flight, but doom'd to fly in vain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confused and panting thus, the hunted deer</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Falls as he flies, a victim to his fear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still must ye wait the foes, and still retire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till yon tall vessels blaze with Trojan fire?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or trust ye, Jove a valiant foe shall chase,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To save a trembling, heartless, dastard race?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, he stalk'd with ample strides along,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Crete's brave monarch and his martial throng;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High at their head he saw the chief appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bold Meriones excite the rear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At this the king his generous joy express'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And clasp'd the warrior to his armed breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Divine Idomeneus! what thanks we owe</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To worth like thine! what praise shall we bestow?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To thee the foremost honours are decreed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First in the fight and every graceful deed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For this, in banquets, when the generous bowls</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Restore our blood, and raise the warriors' souls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though all the rest with stated rules we bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unmix'd, unmeasured, are thy goblets crown'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be still thyself, in arms a mighty name;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Maintain thy honours, and enlarge thy fame."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the Cretan thus his speech address'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Secure of me, O king! exhort the rest.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd to thy side, in every toil I share,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy firm associate in the day of war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But let the signal be this moment given;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To mix in fight is all I ask of Heaven.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The field shall prove how perjuries succeed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And chains or death avenge the impious deed."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Charm'd with this heat, the king his course pursues,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And next the troops of either Ajax views:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In one firm orb the bands were ranged around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A cloud of heroes blacken'd all the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus from the lofty promontory's brow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A swain surveys the gathering storm below;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Slow from the main the heavy vapours rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spread in dim streams, and sail along the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till black as night the swelling tempest shows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The cloud condensing as the west-wind blows:</l>
<pb n="075" /><anchor id="Pg075" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He dreads the impending storm, and drives his flock</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the close covert of an arching rock.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such, and so thick, the embattled squadrons stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With spears erect, a moving iron wood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A shady light was shot from glimmering shields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And their brown arms obscured the dusky fields.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O heroes! worthy such a dauntless train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Exclaim'd the king), who raise your eager bands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With great examples, more than loud commands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah! would the gods but breathe in all the rest</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such souls as burn in your exalted breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon should our arms with just success be crown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Troy's proud walls lie smoking on the ground."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then to the next the general bends his course;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(His heart exults, and glories in his force);</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There reverend Nestor ranks his Pylian bands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And with inspiring eloquence commands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With strictest order sets his train in arms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chiefs advises, and the soldiers warms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, round him wait,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bias the good, and Pelagon the great.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The horse and chariots to the front assign'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The foot (the strength of war) he ranged behind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The middle space suspected troops supply,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Inclosed by both, nor left the power to fly;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He gives command to "curb the fiery steed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor cause confusion, nor the ranks exceed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before the rest let none too rashly ride;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No strength nor skill, but just in time, be tried:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The charge once made, no warrior turn the rein,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But fight, or fall; a firm embodied train.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He whom the fortune of the field shall cast</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From forth his chariot, mount the next in haste;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor seek unpractised to direct the car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Content with javelins to provoke the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our great forefathers held this prudent course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus ruled their ardour, thus preserved their force;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By laws like these immortal conquests made,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And earth's proud tyrants low in ashes laid."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So spoke the master of the martial art,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And touch'd with transport great Atrides' heart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Oh! hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And nerves to second what thy soul inspires!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But wasting years, that wither human race,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Exhaust thy spirits, and thy arms unbrace.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What once thou wert, oh ever mightst thou be!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And age the lot of any chief but thee."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to the experienced prince Atrides cried;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He shook his hoary locks, and thus replied:</l>
<pb n="076" /><anchor id="Pg076" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Well might I wish, could mortal wish renew<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Well might I wish.</hi></p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Would heav'n (said he) my strength and youth recall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such as I was beneath Praeneste's wall—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then when I made the foremost foes retire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And set whole heaps of conquer'd shields on fire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Herilus in single fight I slew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom with three lives Feronia did endue."</l>
</lg>

<p rend="text-align: right">Dryden's Virgil, viii. 742.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That strength which once in boiling youth I knew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such as I was, when Ereuthalion, slain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath this arm, fell prostrate on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But heaven its gifts not all at once bestows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These years with wisdom crowns, with action those:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The field of combat fits the young and bold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The solemn council best becomes the old:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To you the glorious conflict I resign,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let sage advice, the palm of age, be mine."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said. With joy the monarch march'd before,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And found Menestheus on the dusty shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With whom the firm Athenian phalanx stands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And next Ulysses, with his subject bands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Remote their forces lay, nor knew so far</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The peace infringed, nor heard the sounds of war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The tumult late begun, they stood intent</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To watch the motion, dubious of the event.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king, who saw their squadrons yet unmoved,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Can Peleus' son forget a warrior's part.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fears Ulysses, skill'd in every art?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Why stand you distant, and the rest expect</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To mix in combat which yourselves neglect?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From you 'twas hoped among the first to dare</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shock of armies, and commence the war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For this your names are call'd before the rest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To share the pleasures of the genial feast:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And can you, chiefs! without a blush survey</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whole troops before you labouring in the fray?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Say, is it thus those honours you requite?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The first in banquets, but the last in fight."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses heard: the hero's warmth o'erspread</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His cheek with blushes: and severe, he said:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Take back the unjust reproach! Behold we stand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sheathed in bright arms, and but expect command.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If glorious deeds afford thy soul delight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold me plunging in the thickest fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then give thy warrior-chief a warrior's due,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who dares to act whate'er thou dar'st to view."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck with his generous wrath, the king replies:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O great in action, and in council wise!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With ours, thy care and ardour are the same,</l>
<pb n="077" /><anchor id="Pg077" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor need I to commend, nor aught to blame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sage as thou art, and learn'd in human kind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forgive the transport of a martial mind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste to the fight, secure of just amends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gods that make, shall keep the worthy, friends."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and pass'd where great Tydides lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His steeds and chariots wedged in firm array;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The warlike Sthenelus attends his side;)<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Sthenelus,</hi> a son of Capaneus, one of the Epigoni. He
was one of the suitors of Helen, and is said to have been one of those
who entered Troy inside the wooden horse.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom with stern reproach the monarch cried:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O son of Tydeus! (he, whose strength could tame</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bounding steed, in arms a mighty name)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Canst thou, remote, the mingling hosts descry,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With hands unactive, and a careless eye?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not thus thy sire the fierce encounter fear'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still first in front the matchless prince appear'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What glorious toils, what wonders they recite,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who view'd him labouring through the ranks of fight?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I saw him once, when gathering martial powers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A peaceful guest, he sought Mycenae's towers;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Armies he ask'd, and armies had been given,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not we denied, but Jove forbade from heaven;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While dreadful comets glaring from afar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forewarn'd the horrors of the Theban war.<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Forwarn'd the horrors.</hi> The same portent has already
been mentioned. To this day, modern nations are not wholly free from
this superstition.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next, sent by Greece from where Asopus flows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A fearless envoy, he approach'd the foes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thebes' hostile walls unguarded and alone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dauntless he enters, and demands the throne.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dared to combat all those chiefs around:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dared, and subdued before their haughty lord;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For Pallas strung his arm and edged his sword.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stung with the shame, within the winding way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To bar his passage fifty warriors lay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two heroes led the secret squadron on,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mason the fierce, and hardy Lycophon;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those fifty slaughter'd in the gloomy vale.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spared but one to bear the dreadful tale,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such Tydeus was, and such his martial fire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gods! how the son degenerates from the sire!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No words the godlike Diomed return'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But heard respectful, and in secret burn'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so fierce Capaneus' undaunted son;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern as his sire, the boaster thus begun:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What needs, O monarch! this invidious praise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ourselves to lessen, while our sire you raise?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dare to be just, Atrides! and confess</l>
<pb n="078" /><anchor id="Pg078" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our value equal, though our fury less.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With fewer troops we storm'd the Theban wall,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">In impious acts the guilty father died;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far more than heirs of all our parents' fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our glories darken their diminish'd name."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him Tydides thus: "My friend, forbear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Suppress thy passion, and the king revere:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His high concern may well excuse this rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose cause we follow, and whose war we wage:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His the first praise, were Ilion's towers o'erthrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, if we fail, the chief disgrace his own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let him the Greeks to hardy toils excite,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis ours to labour in the glorious fight."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and ardent, on the trembling ground</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from his car: his ringing arms resound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dire was the clang, and dreadful from afar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of arm'd Tydides rushing to the war.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then roars the main, the billows mount the skies,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Trojans and Greeks now gather round the slain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The war renews, the warriors bleed again:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As o'er their prey rapacious wolves engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Man dies on man, and all is blood and rage.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">In blooming youth fair Simoisius fell,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fair Simoisius, whom his mother bore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amid the flocks on silver Simois' shore:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The nymph descending from the hills of Ide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To seek her parents on his flowery side,</l>
<pb n="080" /><anchor id="Pg080" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Brought forth the babe, their common care and joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thence from Simois named the lovely boy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Short was his date! by dreadful Ajax slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He falls, and renders all their cares in vain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So falls a poplar, that in watery ground</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Raised high the head, with stately branches crown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Fell'd by some artist with his shining steel,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To shape the circle of the bending wheel,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Cut down it lies, tall, smooth, and largely spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With all its beauteous honours on its head</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There, left a subject to the wind and rain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And scorch'd by suns, it withers on the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus pierced by Ajax, Simoisius lies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd on the shore, and thus neglected dies.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At Ajax, Antiphus his javelin threw;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The pointed lance with erring fury flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Leucus, loved by wise Ulysses, slew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He drops the corpse of Simoisius slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sinks a breathless carcase on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This saw Ulysses, and with grief enraged,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Strode where the foremost of the foes engaged;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arm'd with his spear, he meditates the wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In act to throw; but cautious look'd around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck at his sight the Trojans backward drew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And trembling heard the javelin as it flew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A chief stood nigh, who from Abydos came,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Old Priam's son, Democoon was his name.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The weapon entered close above his ear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear;<note place="foot"><p>I may, once for all, remark that Homer is most anatomically
correct as to the parts of the body in which a wound would be
immediately mortal.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His eye-balls darken with the shades of death;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ponderous he falls; his clanging arms resound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his broad buckler rings against the ground.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seized with affright the boldest foes appear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">E'en godlike Hector seems himself to fear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Slow he gave way, the rest tumultuous fled;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks with shouts press on, and spoil the dead:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Phoebus now from Ilion's towering height</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shines forth reveal'd, and animates the fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Trojans, be bold, and force with force oppose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor are their bodies rocks, nor ribb'd with steel;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your weapons enter, and your strokes they feel.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Have ye forgot what seem'd your dread before?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great, the fierce Achilles fights no more."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Apollo thus from Ilion's lofty towers,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And shouts and thunders in the fields below.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then great Diores fell, by doom divine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain his valour and illustrious line.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A broken rock the force of Pyrus threw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Who from cold Ænus led the Thracian crew,)<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Ænus,</hi> a fountain almost proverbial for its coldness.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on his ankle dropp'd the ponderous stone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Burst the strong nerves, and crash'd the solid bone.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Supine he tumbles on the crimson sands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before his helpless friends, and native bands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And spreads for aid his unavailing hands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The foe rush'd furious as he pants for breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And through his navel drove the pointed death:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His gushing entrails smoked upon the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the warm life came issuing from the wound.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His lance bold Thoas at the conqueror sent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep in his breast above the pap it went,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amid the lungs was fix'd the winged wood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And quivering in his heaving bosom stood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till from the dying chief, approaching near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Ætolian warrior tugg'd his weighty spear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then sudden waved his flaming falchion round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gash'd his belly with a ghastly wound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The corpse now breathless on the bloody plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To spoil his arms the victor strove in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Thracian bands against the victor press'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A grove of lances glitter'd at his breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern Thoas, glaring with revengeful eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In sullen fury slowly quits the prize.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus fell two heroes; one the pride of Thrace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And one the leader of the Epeian race;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Death's sable shade at once o'ercast their eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In dust the vanquish'd and the victor lies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With copious slaughter all the fields are red,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heap'd with growing mountains of the dead.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had some brave chief this martial scene beheld,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Pallas guarded through the dreadful field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Might darts be bid to turn their points away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And swords around him innocently play;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The war's whole art with wonder had he seen,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And counted heroes where he counted men.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So fought each host, with thirst of glory fired,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And crowds on crowds triumphantly expired.</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE ACTS OF DIOMED.</p>

<p>Diomed, assisted by Pallas, performs wonders in this day's battle.
Pandarus wounds him with an arrow, but the goddess cures him, enables
him to discern gods from mortals, and prohibits him from contending
with any of the former, excepting Venus. Æneas joins Pandarus to
oppose him; Pandarus is killed, and Æneas in great danger but for the
assistance of Venus; who, as she is removing her son from the fight, is
wounded on the hand by Diomed. Apollo seconds her in his rescue, and at
length carries off Æneas to Troy, where he is healed in the temple of
Pergamus. Mars rallies the Trojans, and assists Hector to make a stand.
In the meantime Æneas is restored to the field, and they overthrow
several of the Greeks; among the rest Tlepolemus is slain by Sarpedon.
Juno and Minerva descend to resist Mars; the latter incites Diomed to
go against that god; he wounds him, and sends him groaning to heaven.</p>

<p>The first battle continues through this book. The scene is the same as
in the former.</p>


<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Pallas now Tydides' soul inspires,<note place="foot"><p>Compare Tasso, Gier. Lib., xx. 7:</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Nuovo favor del cielo in lui niluce</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">E 'l fa grande, et angusto oltre il costume.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fills with her force, and warms with all her fires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Above the Greeks his deathless fame to raise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And crown her hero with distinguish'd praise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on his helm celestial lightnings play,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His beamy shield emits a living ray;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like the red star that fires the autumnal skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, bathed in ocean, shoots a keener light.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such glories Pallas on the chief bestow'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Onward she drives him, furious to engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sons of Dares first the combat sought,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A wealthy priest, but rich without a fault;</l>
<pb n="084" /><anchor id="Pg084" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In Vulcan's fane the father's days were led,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sons to toils of glorious battle bred;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These singled from their troops the fight maintain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These, from their steeds, Tydides on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And first bold Phegeus cast his sounding spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And spent in empty air its erring force.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But pierced his breast, and stretch'd him on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And had not Vulcan lent celestial aid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He too had sunk to death's eternal shade;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But in a smoky cloud the god of fire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Preserved the son, in pity to the sire.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The steeds and chariot, to the navy led,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Increased the spoils of gallant Diomed.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck with amaze and shame, the Trojan crew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or slain, or fled, the sons of Dares view;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When by the blood-stain'd hand Minerva press'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god of battles, and this speech address'd:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Stern power of war! by whom the mighty fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While we from interdicted fields retire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor tempt the wrath of heaven's avenging sire."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her words allay the impetuous warrior's heat,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god of arms and martial maid retreat;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Removed from fight, on Xanthus' flowery bounds</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They sat, and listen'd to the dying sounds.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And some bold chieftain every leader slew:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First Odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His death ennobled by Atrides' hand:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As he to flight his wheeling car address'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The speedy javelin drove from back to breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In dust the mighty Halizonian lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His arms resound, the spirit wings its way.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy fate was next, O Phaestus! doom'd to feel</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great Idomeneus' protended steel;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom Borus sent (his son and only joy)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Cretan javelin reach'd him from afar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Back from the car he tumbles to the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And everlasting shades his eyes surround.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then died Scamandrius, expert in the chase,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In woods and wilds to wound the savage race;</l>
<pb n="085" /><anchor id="Pg085" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Diana taught him all her sylvan arts,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To bend the bow, and aim unerring darts:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But vainly here Diana's arts he tries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fatal lance arrests him as he flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Menelaus' arm the weapon sent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through his broad back and heaving bosom went:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His brazen armour rings against the ground.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next artful Phereclus untimely fell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bold Merion sent him to the realms of hell.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy father's skill, O Phereclus! was thine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The graceful fabric and the fair design;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For loved by Pallas, Pallas did impart</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him the shipwright's and the builder's art.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fatal cause of all his country's woes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor saw his country's peril, nor his own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hapless artist, while confused he fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spear of Merion mingled with the dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through his right hip, with forceful fury cast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Between the bladder and the bone it pass'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Meges' force the swift Pedaeus fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antenor's offspring from a foreign bed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose generous spouse, Theanor, heavenly fair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nursed the young stranger with a mother's care.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How vain those cares! when Meges in the rear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full in his nape infix'd the fatal spear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then died Hypsenor, generous and divine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from the brave Dolopion's mighty line,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who near adored Scamander made abode,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Priest of the stream, and honoured as a god.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On him, amidst the flying numbers found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thence glancing downwards, lopp'd his holy hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which stain'd with sacred blood the blushing sand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Down sunk the priest: the purple hand of death</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Closed his dim eye, and fate suppress'd his breath.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus toil'd the chiefs, in different parts engaged.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In every quarter fierce Tydides raged;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amid the Greek, amid the Trojan train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rapt through the ranks he thunders o'er the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now here, now there, he darts from place to place,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pours on the rear, or lightens in their face.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong</l>
<pb n="086" /><anchor id="Pg086" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through ruin'd moles the rushing wave resounds,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So raged Tydides, boundless in his ire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drove armies back, and made all Troy retire.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With grief the leader of the Lycian band</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Saw the wide waste of his destructive hand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His bended bow against the chief he drew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep in his shoulder pierced, and drank the gore:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rushing stream his brazen armour dyed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the proud archer thus exulting cried:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hither, ye Trojans, hither drive your steeds!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not long the deathful dart he can sustain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or Phoebus urged me to these fields in vain."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So spoke he, boastful: but the winged dart</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stopp'd short of life, and mock'd the shooter's art.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wounded chief, behind his car retired,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The helping hand of Sthenelus required;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift from his seat he leap'd upon the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And tugg'd the weapon from the gushing wound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When thus the king his guardian power address'd,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy winged arrows and unerring bow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall'd fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And boasted glory of the Lycian name?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O pierce that mortal! if we mortal call</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That wondrous force by which whole armies fall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or god incensed, who quits the distant skies</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whoe'er he be, propitiate Jove with prayer;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If man, destroy; if god, entreat to spare."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him the Lycian: "Whom your eyes behold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If right I judge, is Diomed the bold:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such coursers whirl him o'er the dusty field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So towers his helmet, and so flames his shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If 'tis a god, he wears that chief's disguise:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or if that chief, some guardian of the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Involved in clouds, protects him in the fray,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And turns unseen the frustrate dart away.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I wing'd an arrow, which not idly fell,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stroke had fix'd him to the gates of hell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, but some god, some angry god withstands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fate was due to these unerring hands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Skill'd in the bow, on foot I sought the war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor join'd swift horses to the rapid car.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ten polish'd chariots I possess'd at home,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And still they grace Lycaon's princely dome:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There veil'd in spacious coverlets they stand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And twice ten coursers wait their lord's command.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The good old warrior bade me trust to these,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When first for Troy I sail'd the sacred seas;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And through the ranks of death triumphant ride.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclined,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I heard his counsels with unheedful mind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thought the steeds (your large supplies unknown)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Might fail of forage in the straiten'd town;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So took my bow and pointed darts in hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And left the chariots in my native land.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And undissembled gore pursued the wound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain they bleed: this unavailing bow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Serves, not to slaughter, but provoke the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In evil hour these bended horns I strung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And seized the quiver where it idly hung.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Cursed be the fate that sent me to the field</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Without a warrior's arms, the spear and shield!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If e'er with life I quit the Trojan plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If e'er I see my spouse and sire again,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This bow, unfaithful to my glorious aims,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Broke by my hand, shall feed the blazing flames."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the leader of the Dardan race:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Be calm, nor Phoebus' honour'd gift disgrace.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rushing chariot and the bounding steed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against yon hero let us bend our course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, hand to hand, encounter force with force.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now mount my seat, and from the chariot's height</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Observe my father's steeds, renown'd in fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To dare the shock, or urge the rapid race;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Secure with these, through fighting fields we go;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or safe to Troy, if Jove assist the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste, seize the whip, and snatch the guiding rein;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior's fury let this arm sustain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or, if to combat thy bold heart incline,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Take thou the spear, the chariot's care be mine."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O prince! (Lycaon's valiant son replied)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thine the steeds, be thine the task to guide.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The horses, practised to their lord's command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall bear the rein, and answer to thy hand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But, if, unhappy, we desert the fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy voice alone can animate their flight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Else shall our fates be number'd with the dead,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And these, the victor's prize, in triumph led.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thine be the guidance, then: with spear and shield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Myself will charge this terror of the field."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now both heroes mount the glittering car;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bounding coursers rush amidst the war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their fierce approach bold Sthenelus espied,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who thus, alarm'd, to great Tydides cried:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O friend! two chiefs of force immense I see,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dreadful they come, and bend their rage on thee:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo the brave heir of old Lycaon's line,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And great Æneas, sprung from race divine!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Enough is given to fame. Ascend thy car!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And save a life, the bulwark of our war."</l>
</lg>

<pb n="090" /><anchor id="Pg090" />

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At this the hero cast a gloomy look,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd on the chief with scorn; and thus he spoke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Me wouldst thou move to base, inglorious flight?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Know, 'tis not honest in my soul to fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor was Tydides born to tremble here.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I hate the cumbrous chariot's slow advance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the long distance of the flying lance;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But while my nerves are strong, my force entire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus front the foe, and emulate my sire.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those threatening heroes, bear them both away;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One chief at least beneath this arm shall die;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Pallas tells me, and forbids to fly.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But if she dooms, and if no god withstand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That both shall fall by one victorious hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then heed my words: my horses here detain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd to the chariot by the straiten'd rein;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift to Æneas' empty seat proceed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And seize the coursers of ethereal breed;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who from their nostrils breathed ethereal fire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By substituting mares produced on earth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose wombs conceived a more than mortal birth.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hence great Anchises stole a breed unknown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By mortal mares, from fierce Laomedon:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Four of this race his ample stalls contain,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus while they spoke, the foe came furious on,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stern Lycaon's warlike race begun:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Prince, thou art met. Though late in vain assail'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spear may enter where the arrow fail'd."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, then shook the ponderous lance, and flung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On his broad shield the sounding weapon rung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced the tough orb, and in his cuirass hung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"He bleeds! the pride of Greece! (the boaster cries,)</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Mistaken vaunter! (Diomed replied;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy dart has erred, and now my spear be tried;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ye 'scape not both; one, headlong from his car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With hostile blood shall glut the god of war."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and rising hurl'd his forceful dart,</l>
<pb n="091" /><anchor id="Pg091" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which, driven by Pallas, pierced a vital part;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full in his face it enter'd, and betwixt</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The nose and eye-ball the proud Lycian fix'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Crash'd all his jaws, and cleft the tongue within,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till the bright point look'd out beneath the chin.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Headlong he falls, his helmet knocks the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Earth groans beneath him, and his arms resound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The starting coursers tremble with affright;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The soul indignant seeks the realms of night.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guard his slaughter'd friend, Æneas flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His spear extending where the carcase lies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Watchful he wheels, protects it every way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As the grim lion stalks around his prey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er the fall'n trunk his ample shield display'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He hides the hero with his mighty shade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And threats aloud! the Greeks with longing eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold at distance, but forbear the prize.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then fierce Tydides stoops; and from the fields</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaved with vast force, a rocky fragment wields.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such men as live in these degenerate days:<note place="foot"><p>The belief in the existence of men of larger stature in

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He swung it round; and, gathering strength to throw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where to the hip the inserted thigh unites,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the bone the pointed marble lights;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through both the tendons broke the rugged stone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stripp'd the skin, and crack'd the solid bone.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sunk on his knees, and staggering with his pains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His falling bulk his bended arm sustains;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sudden cloud comes swimming o'er his eyes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There the brave chief, who mighty numbers sway'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oppress'd had sunk to death's eternal shade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But heavenly Venus, mindful of the love</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Screen'd from the foe behind her shining veil,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Whom most he loved, as brave men love the brave,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then mounting on his car, resumed the rein,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And follow'd where Tydides swept the plain.</l>
</lg>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile (his conquest ravished from his eyes)</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before her mother, love's bright queen appears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'erwhelmed with anguish, and dissolved in tears:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She raised her in her arms, beheld her bleed,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, she wiped from Venus' wounded palm</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Juno and Pallas with a smile survey'd,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To quit her country for some youth of Troy;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The clasping zone, with golden buckles bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Razed her soft hand with this lamented wound."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sire of gods and men superior smiled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, calling Venus, thus address'd his child:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Not these, O daughter are thy proper cares,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thee milder arts befit, and softer wars;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sweet smiles are thine, and kind endearing charms;</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus they in heaven: while on the plain below</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fierce Tydides charged his Dardan foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Flush'd with celestial blood pursued his way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fearless dared the threatening god of day;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already in his hopes he saw him kill'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though screen'd behind Apollo's mighty shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrice rushing furious, at the chief he strook;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His blazing buckler thrice Apollo shook:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He tried the fourth: when, breaking from the cloud,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O son of Tydeus, cease! be wise and see</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How vast the difference of the gods and thee;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Distance immense! between the powers that shine</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Above, eternal, deathless, and divine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And mortal man! a wretch of humble birth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A short-lived reptile in the dust of earth."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So spoke the god who darts celestial fires:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He dreads his fury, and some steps retires.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Phoebus bore the chief of Venus' race</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Troy's high fane, and to his holy place;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Latona there and Phoebe heal'd the wound,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">A phantom raised, the same in shape and show</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With great Æneas; such the form he bore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And such in fight the radiant arms he wore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around the spectre bloody wars are waged,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Greece and Troy with clashing shields engaged.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime on Ilion's tower Apollo stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And calling Mars, thus urged the raging god:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Stern power of arms, by whom the mighty fall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who bathest in blood, and shakest the embattled wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rise in thy wrath! to hell's abhorr'd abodes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Despatch yon Greek, and vindicate the gods.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First rosy Venus felt his brutal rage;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Me next he charged, and dares all heaven engage:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wretch would brave high heaven's immortal sire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His triple thunder, and his bolts of fire."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god of battle issues on the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stirs all the ranks, and fires the Trojan train;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In form like Acamas, the Thracian guide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Enraged to Troy's retiring chiefs he cried:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"How long, ye sons of Priam! will ye fly,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And unrevenged see Priam's people die?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still unresisted shall the foe destroy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stretch the slaughter to the gates of Troy?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo, brave Æneas sinks beneath his wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not godlike Hector more in arms renown'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste all, and take the generous warrior's part.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said;—new courage swell'd each hero's heart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sarpedon first his ardent soul express'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, turn'd to Hector, these bold words address'd:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Say, chief, is all thy ancient valour lost?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where are thy threats, and where thy glorious boast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That propp'd alone by Priam's race should stand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy's sacred walls, nor need a foreign hand?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now, now thy country calls her wonted friends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the proud vaunt in just derision ends.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Remote they stand while alien troops engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like trembling hounds before the lion's rage.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far distant hence I held my wide command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where foaming Xanthus laves the Lycian land;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With ample wealth (the wish of mortals) bless'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A beauteous wife, and infant at her breast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With those I left whatever dear could be:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece, if she conquers, nothing wins from me;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet first in fight my Lycian bands I cheer,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And long to meet this mighty man ye fear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Hector idle stands, nor bids the brave</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their wives, their infants, and their altars save.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste, warrior, haste! preserve thy threaten'd state,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or one vast burst of all-involving fate</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full o'er your towers shall fall, and sweep away</l>
<pb n="097" /><anchor id="Pg097" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sons, sires, and wives, an undistinguish'd prey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rouse all thy Trojans, urge thy aids to fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These claim thy thoughts by day, thy watch by night;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With force incessant the brave Greeks oppose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such cares thy friends deserve, and such thy foes."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stung to the heart the generous Hector hears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But just reproof with decent silence bears.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his proud car the prince impetuous springs,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On earth he leaps, his brazen armour rings.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two shining spears are brandish'd in his hands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus arm'd, he animates his drooping bands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They turn, they stand; the Greeks their fury dare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Condense their powers, and wait the growing war.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when, on Ceres' sacred floor, the swain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the light chaff, before the breezes borne,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The grey dust, rising with collected winds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drives o'er the barn, and whitens all the hinds:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So white with dust the Grecian host appears.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From trampling steeds, and thundering charioteers;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dusky clouds from labour'd earth arise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And roll in smoking volumes to the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mars hovers o'er them with his sable shield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And adds new horrors to the darken'd field:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pleased with his charge, and ardent to fulfil,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In Troy's defence, Apollo's heavenly will:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as from fight the blue-eyed maid retires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each Trojan bosom with new warmth he fires.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now the god, from forth his sacred fane,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Produced Æneas to the shouting train;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alive, unharm'd, with all his peers around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Erect he stood, and vigorous from his wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Inquiries none they made; the dreadful day</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No pause of words admits, no dull delay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce Discord storms, Apollo loud exclaims,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fame calls, Mars thunders, and the field's in flames.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern Diomed with either Ajax stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And great Ulysses, bathed in hostile blood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Embodied close, the labouring Grecian train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unmoved and silent, the whole war they wait</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Serenely dreadful, and as fix'd as fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So when the embattled clouds in dark array,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Along the skies their gloomy lines display;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When now the North his boisterous rage has spent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And peaceful sleeps the liquid element:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The low-hung vapours, motionless and still,</l>
<pb n="098" /><anchor id="Pg098" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rest on the summits of the shaded hill;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till the mass scatters as the winds arise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor was the general wanting to his train;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From troop to troop he toils through all the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye Greeks, be men! the charge of battle bear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your brave associates and yourselves revere!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And catch from breast to breast the noble fire!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On valour's side the odds of combat lie,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brave live glorious, or lamented die;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wretch who trembles in the field of fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These words he seconds with his flying lance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To meet whose point was strong Deicoon's chance:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Æneas' friend, and in his native place</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Honour'd and loved like Priam's royal race:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long had he fought the foremost in the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But now the monarch's lance transpierced his shield:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His shield too weak the furious dart to stay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through his broad belt the weapon forced its way:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The grisly wound dismiss'd his soul to hell,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His arms around him rattled as he fell.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then fierce Æneas, brandishing his blade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In dust Orsilochus and Crethon laid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose sire Diocleus, wealthy, brave and great,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In well-built Pherae held his lofty seat:<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Pherae,</hi> a town of Pelasgiotis, in Thessaly.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from Alpheus' plenteous stream, that yields</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Increase of harvests to the Pylian fields.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He got Orsilochus, Diocleus he,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And these descended in the third degree.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Too early expert in the martial toil,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In sable ships they left their native soil,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To avenge Atrides: now, untimely slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They fell with glory on the Phrygian plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So two young mountain lions, nursed with blood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In deep recesses of the gloomy wood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rush fearless to the plains, and uncontroll'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Depopulate the stalls and waste the fold:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till pierced at distance from their native den,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'erpowered they fall beneath the force of men.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like mountain firs, as tall and straight as they.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Menelaus views with pitying eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lifts his bright lance, and at the victor flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mars urged him on; yet, ruthless in his hate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god but urged him to provoke his fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He thus advancing, Nestor's valiant son</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shakes for his danger, and neglects his own;</l>
<pb n="099" /><anchor id="Pg099" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck with the thought, should Helen's lord be slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all his country's glorious labours vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already met, the threatening heroes stand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spears already tremble in their hand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In rush'd Antilochus, his aid to bring,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fall or conquer by the Spartan king.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These seen, the Dardan backward turn'd his course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Brave as he was, and shunn'd unequal force.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The breathless bodies to the Greeks they drew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then mix in combat, and their toils renew.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First, Pylaemenes, great in battle, bled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who sheathed in brass the Paphlagonians led.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Atrides mark'd him where sublime he stood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd in his throat the javelin drank his blood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The faithful Mydon, as he turn'd from fight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His flying coursers, sunk to endless night;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A broken rock by Nestor's son was thrown:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His bended arm received the falling stone;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his numb'd hand the ivory-studded reins,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dropp'd in the dust, are trail'd along the plains:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He groans in death, and ponderous sinks to ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep drove his helmet in the sands, and there</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The head stood fix'd, the quivering legs in air,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till trampled flat beneath the coursers' feet:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youthful victor mounts his empty seat,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bears the prize in triumph to the fleet.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Hector saw, and, raging at the view,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pours on the Greeks: the Trojan troops pursue:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He fires his host with animating cries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And brings along the furies of the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mars, stern destroyer! and Bellona dread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Flame in the front, and thunder at their head:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This swells the tumult and the rage of fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where Hector march'd, the god of battles shined,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tydides paused amidst his full career;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then first the hero's manly breast knew fear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when some simple swain his cot forsakes,</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE EPISODES OF GLAUCUS AND DIOMED, AND OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE.</p>

<p>The gods having left the field, the Grecians prevail. Helenus, the
chief augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to
appoint a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the
temple of Minerva, to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. The
battle relaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed have
an interview between the two armies; where, coming to the knowledge, of
the friendship and hospitality passed between their ancestors, they
make exchange of their arms. Hector, having performed the orders of
Helenus, prevails upon Paris to return to the battle, and, taking a
tender leave of his wife Andromache, hastens again to the field.</p>

<p>The scene is first in the field of battle, between the rivers Simois
and Scamander, and then changes to Troy.</p>



<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now heaven forsakes the fight: the immortals yield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To human force and human skill the field:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now here, now there, the tide of combat flows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Troy's famed streams, that bound the deathful plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On either side, run purple to the main.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Ajax first to conquest led the way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Broke the thick ranks, and turn'd the doubtful day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Thracian Acamas his falchion found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hew'd the enormous giant to the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His thundering arm a deadly stroke impress'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where the black horse-hair nodded o'er his crest;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd in his front the brazen weapon lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And seals in endless shades his swimming eyes.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">No friend to guard him in the dreadful day!</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Breathless the good man fell, and by his side</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His faithful servant, old Calesius died.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By great Euryalus was Dresus slain,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And two fair infants crown'd his strong embrace:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here dead they lay in all their youthful charms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ruthless victor stripp'd their shining arms.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Astyalus by Polypoetes fell;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Agamemnon, leader of the brave,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unbless'd Adrastus next at mercy lies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath the Spartan spear, a living prize.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scared with the din and tumult of the fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His headlong steeds, precipitate in flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rush'd on a tamarisk's strong trunk, and broke</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wide o'er the field, resistless as the wind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For Troy they fly, and leave their lord behind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone on his face he sinks beside the wheel:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Atrides o'er him shakes his vengeful steel;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fallen chief in suppliant posture press'd</l>

yet unemployed metal—gold, copper, and iron are stored up in the
treasure-chamber of Odysseus and other chiefs. Coined money is unknown
in the Homeric age—the trade carried on being one of barter. In
reference also to the metals, it deserves to be remarked, that the
Homeric descriptions universally suppose copper, and not iron, to be
employed for arms, both offensive and defensive. By what process the
copper was tempered and hardened, so as to serve the purpose of the
warrior, we do not know; but the use of iron for these objects belongs
to a later age."—Grote, vol. ii. p. 142.</p></note></l>

illustrated by the following remarks of Mure, vol. i. p.298: "The
poet's method of introducing his episode, also, illustrates in a
curious manner his tact in the dramatic department of his art. Where,
for example, one or more heroes are despatched on some commission, to
be executed at a certain distance of time or place, the fulfilment of
this task is not, as a general rule, immediately described. A certain
interval is allowed them for reaching the appointed scene of action,
which interval is dramatised, as it were, either by a temporary
continuation of the previous narrative, or by fixing attention for a
while on some new transaction, at the close of which the further
account of the mission is resumed."</p></note></l>

irregular burst of popular indignation to which Hector alludes, when he
regrets that the Trojans had not spirit enough to cover Paris with a
mantle of stones. This, however, was also one of the ordinary formal
modes of punishment for great public offences. It may have been
originally connected with the same feeling—the desire of avoiding the
pollution of bloodshed—which seems to have suggested the practice of
burying prisoners alive, with a scantling of food by their side. Though
Homer makes no mention of this horrible usage, the example of the Roman
Vestals affords reasons for believing that, in ascribing it to the
heroic ages, Sophocles followed an authentic tradition."—Thirlwall's

he dwells on their metallic ornaments that the higher beauty of
proportion was but little required or understood, and it is, perhaps,
strength and convenience, rather than elegance, that he means to

<l rend="margin-left: 2">(O wretch ill-fated, and thy country's foe!)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Paris and Greece against us both conspire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy close resentment, and their vengeful ire.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till heaps of dead alone defend her wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For thee the soldier bleeds, the matron mourns,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wasteful war in all its fury burns.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ungrateful man! deserves not this thy care,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had seen my death! why did not whirlwinds bear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fatal infant to the fowls of air?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Why sunk I not beneath the whelming tide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And midst the roarings of the waters died?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaven fill'd up all my ills, and I accursed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bore all, and Paris of those ills the worst.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Helen at least a braver spouse might claim,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief replied: "This time forbids to rest;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojan bands, by hostile fury press'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Demand their Hector, and his arm require;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">At home he sought her, but he sought in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She, with one maid of all her menial train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had hence retired; and with her second joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The young Astyanax, the hope of Troy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pensive she stood on Ilion's towery height,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose virtue charm'd him as her beauty fired,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stood in the gates, and ask'd "what way she bent</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her parting step? If to the fane she went,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where late the mourning matrons made resort;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or sought her sisters in the Trojan court?"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Not to the court, (replied the attendant train,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor mix'd with matrons to Minerva's fane:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Ilion's steepy tower she bent her way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To mark the fortunes of the doubtful day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy fled, she heard, before the Grecian sword;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She heard, and trembled for her absent lord:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fear on her cheek, and sorrow m her eye.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The nurse attended with her infant boy,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector this heard, return'd without delay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift through the town he trod his former way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through streets of palaces, and walks of state;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And met the mourner at the Scaean gate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">His beauteous princess cast a mournful look,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And think'st thou not how wretched we shall be,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A widow I, a helpless orphan he?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For sure such courage length of life denies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thou must fall, thy virtue's sacrifice.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece in her single heroes strove in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now hosts oppose thee, and thou must be slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O grant me, gods, ere Hector meets his doom,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All I can ask of heaven, an early tomb!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So shall my days in one sad tenor run,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And end with sorrows as they first begun.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No parent now remains my griefs to share,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No father's aid, no mother's tender care.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fierce Achilles wrapt our walls in fire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Laid Thebe waste, and slew my warlike sire!</l>
<pb n="122" /><anchor id="Pg122" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fate compassion in the victor bred;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern as he was, he yet revered the dead,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And laid him decent on the funeral pile;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then raised a mountain where his bones were burn'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mountain-nymphs the rural tomb adorn'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove's sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A barren shade, and in his honour grow.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"By the same arm my seven brave brothers fell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In one sad day beheld the gates of hell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amid their fields the hapless heroes bled!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My mother lived to wear the victor's bands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The queen of Hippoplacia's sylvan lands:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Redeem'd too late, she scarce beheld again</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her pleasing empire and her native plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When ah! oppress'd by life-consuming woe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She fell a victim to Diana's bow.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Yet while my Hector still survives, I see</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My father, mother, brethren, all, in thee:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alas! my parents, brothers, kindred, all</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Once more will perish, if my Hector fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy wife, thy infant, in thy danger share:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh, prove a husband's and a father's care!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That quarter most the skilful Greeks annoy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where yon wild fig-trees join the wall of Troy;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">There Agamemnon points his dreadful host,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or led by hopes, or dictated from heaven.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let others in the field their arms employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But stay my Hector here, and guard his Troy."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief replied: "That post shall be my care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not that alone, but all the works of war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How would the sons of Troy, in arms renown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Troy's proud dames, whose garments sweep the ground</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Attaint the lustre of my former name,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should Hector basely quit the field of fame?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My early youth was bred to martial pains,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And see thy warriors fall, thy glories end.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And yet no dire presage so wounds my mind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My mother's death, the ruin of my kind,</l>
<pb n="123" /><anchor id="Pg123" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not Priam's hoary hairs defiled with gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not all my brothers gasping on the shore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thine, Andromache! Thy griefs I dread:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I see thee trembling, weeping, captive led!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In Argive looms our battles to design,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And woes, of which so large a part was thine!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To bear the victor's hard commands, or bring</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The weight of waters from Hyperia's spring.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There while you groan beneath the load of life,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They cry, 'Behold the mighty Hector's wife!'</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Imbitters all thy woes, by naming me.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The thoughts of glory past, and present shame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A thousand griefs shall waken at the name!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">May I lie cold before that dreadful day,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Press'd with a load of monumental clay!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy Hector, wrapt in everlasting sleep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus having spoke, the illustrious chief of Troy</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The babe clung crying to his nurse's breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Hector hasted to relieve his child,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The glittering terrors from his brows unbound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And placed the beaming helmet on the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then kiss'd the child, and, lifting high in air,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to the gods preferr'd a father's prayer:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O thou! whose glory fills the ethereal throne,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all ye deathless powers! protect my son!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against his country's foes the war to wage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rise the Hector of the future age!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So when triumphant from successful toils</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And say, 'This chief transcends his father's fame:'</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While pleased amidst the general shouts of Troy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Restored the pleasing burden to her arms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hush'd to repose, and with a smile survey'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She mingled with a smile a tender tear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The soften'd chief with kind compassion view'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Andromache! my soul's far better part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?</l>
<pb n="124" /><anchor id="Pg124" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No hostile hand can antedate my doom,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd is the term to all the race of earth;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And such the hard condition of our birth:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No force can then resist, no flight can save,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All sink alike, the fearful and the brave.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more—but hasten to thy tasks at home,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There guide the spindle, and direct the loom:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Me glory summons to the martial scene,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The field of combat is the sphere for men.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The first in danger as the first in fame."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His towery helmet, black with shading plumes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His princess parts with a prophetic sigh,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That stream'd at every look; then, moving slow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sought her own palace, and indulged her woe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There, while her tears deplored the godlike man,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through all her train the soft infection ran;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And mourn the living Hector, as the dead.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But now, no longer deaf to honour's call,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth issues Paris from the palace wall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray,</l>

<p>ARGUMENT</p>

<p>THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.</p>

<p>The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector,
Minerva is under apprehensions for the Greeks. Apollo, seeing her
descend from Olympus, joins her near the Scaean gate. They agree to put
off the general engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge
the Greeks to a single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the
challenge, the lot is cast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after
several attacks, are parted by the night. The Trojans calling a
council, Antenor purposes the delivery of Helen to the Greeks, to which
Paris will not consent, but offers to restore them her riches. Priam
sends a herald to make this offer, and to demand a truce for burning
the dead, the last of which only is agreed to by Agamemnon. When the
funerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of Nestor,
erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with
towers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune testifies his
jealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter. Both
armies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans
with thunder, and other signs of his wrath.</p>

<p>The three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax, the
next day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the funeral rites
of the slain and one more in building the fortification before the
ships. So that somewhat about three days is employed in this book. The
scene lies wholly in the field.</p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Grieved though thou art, forbear the rash design;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Hectors arm is mightier far than thine:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and turn'd his brother's vengeful mind;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sends thee one, a sample of her host,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such as I am, I come to prove thy might;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more—be sudden, and begin the fight."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O son of Telamon, thy country's pride!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Me, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">New to the field, and trembling at the fight?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou meet'st a chief deserving of thy arms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To combat born, and bred amidst alarms:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I know to shift my ground, remount the car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Turn, charge, and answer every call of war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bear thick battle on my sounding shield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But open be our fight, and bold each blow;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I steal no conquest from a noble foe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and rising, high above the field</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whirl'd the long lance against the sevenfold shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the brass descending from above</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till in the seventh it fix'd. Then Ajax threw;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through Hector's shield the forceful javelin flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His corslet enters, and his garment rends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And glancing downwards, near his flank descends.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then close impetuous, and the charge renew;</l>
<pb n="134" /><anchor id="Pg134" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The blunted point against the buckler bends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It reach'd his neck, with matchless strength impell'd!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Black, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the brazen boss the stone descends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hollow brass resounded with the shock:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Applied each nerve, and swinging round on high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His slacken'd knees received the numbing stroke;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Hector falls extended on the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His bulk supporting on the shatter'd shield:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo's might</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confirm'd his sinews, and restored to fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now both heroes their broad falchions drew</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In flaming circles round their heads they flew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But then by heralds' voice the word was given.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sacred ministers of earth and heaven:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The baldric studded, and the sheath enchased,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">A radiant belt that rich with purple glow'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then with majestic grace they quit the plain;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">When now the rage of hunger was removed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nestor, in each persuasive art approved,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sage whose counsels long had sway'd the rest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In words like these his prudent thought express'd:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"How dear, O kings! this fatal day has cost,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What Greeks are perish'd! what a people lost!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What tides of blood have drench'd Scamander's shore!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then hear me, chief! nor let the morrow's light</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some space at least permit the war to breathe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While we to flames our slaughter'd friends bequeath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the red field their scatter'd bodies bear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So decent urns their snowy bones may keep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pious children o'er their ashes weep.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here, where on one promiscuous pile they blazed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High o'er them all a general tomb be raised;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next, to secure our camp and naval powers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Raise an embattled wall, with lofty towers;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From space to space be ample gates around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For passing chariots; and a trench profound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Greece to combat shall in safety go,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sceptred kings of Greece his words approved.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile, convened at Priam's palace-gate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojan peers in nightly council sate;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A senate void of order, as of choice:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their hearts were fearful, and confused their voice.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antenor, rising, thus demands their ear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliars, hear!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And I but move what every god requires:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let Sparta's treasures be this hour restored,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Argive Helen own her ancient lord.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ties of faith, the sworn alliance, broke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our impious battles the just gods provoke.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As this advice ye practise, or reject,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So hope success, or dread the dire effect."</l>
</lg>

<pb n="137" /><anchor id="Pg137" />

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The senior spoke and sate. To whom replied</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The graceful husband of the Spartan bride:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Cold counsels, Trojan, may become thy years</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But sound ungrateful in a warrior's ears:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Old man, if void of fallacy or art,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy words express the purpose of thy heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But wisdom has its date, assign'd by heaven.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then hear me, princes of the Trojan name!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their treasures I'll restore, but not the dame;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My treasures too, for peace, I will resign;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But be this bright possession ever mine."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Twas then, the growing discord to compose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Slow from his seat the reverend Priam rose:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His godlike aspect deep attention drew:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He paused, and these pacific words ensue:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliar bands!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now take refreshment as the hour demands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Guard well the walls, relieve the watch of night.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till the new sun restores the cheerful light.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then shall our herald, to the Atrides sent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before their ships proclaim my son's intent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next let a truce be ask'd, that Troy may burn</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That done, once more the fate of war be tried,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The monarch spoke: the warriors snatch'd with haste</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Each at his post in arms) a short repast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as the rosy morn had waked the day,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the black ships Idaeus bent his way;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There, to the sons of Mars, in council found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He raised his voice: the host stood listening round.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Greeks, give ear!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The words of Troy, and Troy's great monarch, hear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pleased may ye hear (so heaven succeed my prayers)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What Paris, author of the war, declares.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spoils and treasures he to Ilion bore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Oh had he perish'd ere they touch'd our shore!)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He proffers injured Greece: with large increase</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of added Trojan wealth to buy the peace.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But to restore the beauteous bride again,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This Greece demands, and Troy requests in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next, O ye chiefs! we ask a truce to burn</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That done, once more the fate of war be tried,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks gave ear, but none the silence broke;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At length Tydides rose, and rising spoke:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Oh, take not, friends! defrauded of your fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their proffer'd wealth, nor even the Spartan dame.</l>
<pb n="138" /><anchor id="Pg138" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let conquest make them ours: fate shakes their wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Troy already totters to her fall."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The admiring chiefs, and all the Grecian name,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With general shouts return'd him loud acclaim.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus the king of kings rejects the peace:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Herald! in him thou hear'st the voice of Greece</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For what remains; let funeral flames be fed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With heroes' corps: I war not with the dead:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gratify the manes of the slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be witness, Jove, whose thunder rolls on high!"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and rear'd his sceptre to the sky.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To sacred Troy, where all her princes lay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To wait the event, the herald bent his way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He came, and standing in the midst, explain'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The peace rejected, but the truce obtain'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Straight to their several cares the Trojans move,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some search the plains, some fell the sounding grove:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor less the Greeks, descending on the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hew'd the green forests, and the bodies bore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now from forth the chambers of the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To shed his sacred light on earth again,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arose the golden chariot of the day,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And tipp'd the mountains with a purple ray.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through heaps of carnage search'd the mournful plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce could the friend his slaughter'd friend explore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With dust dishonour'd, and deformed with gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wounds they wash'd, their pious tears they shed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, laid along their cars, deplored the dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sage Priam check'd their grief: with silent haste</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bodies decent on the piles were placed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With melting hearts the cold remains they burn'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, sadly slow, to sacred Troy return'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And decent on the pile dispose the dead;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The cold remains consume with equal care;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now, ere the morn had streak'd with reddening light</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The doubtful confines of the day and night,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">About the dying flames the Greeks appear'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And round the pile a general tomb they rear'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, to secure the camp and naval powers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They raised embattled walls with lofty towers:<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Embattled walls.</hi> "Another essential basis of mechanical
unity in the poem is the construction of the rampart. This takes place
in the seventh book. The reason ascribed for the glaring improbability
that the Greeks should have left their camp and fleet unfortified
during nine years, in the midst of a hostile country, is a purely
poetical one: 'So long as Achilles fought, the terror of his name
sufficed to keep every foe at a distance.' The disasters consequent
on his secession first led to the necessity of other means of
protection. Accordingly, in the battles previous to the eighth book,
no allusion occurs to a rampart; in all those which follow it forms a
prominent feature. Here, then, in the anomaly as in the propriety of
the Iliad, the destiny of Achilles, or rather this peculiar crisis of
it, forms the pervading bond of connexion to the whole poem."—Mure,

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE SECOND BATTLE, AND THE DISTRESS OF THE GREEKS.</p>

<p>Jupiter assembles a council of the deities, and threatens them
with the pains of Tartarus if they assist either side: Minerva only
obtains of him that she may direct the Greeks by her counsels.<note place="foot"><p>"A similar bond of connexion, in the military details of the
narrative, is the decree issued by Jupiter, at the commencement of the
eighth book, against any further interference of the gods in the
battles. In the opening of the twentieth book this interdict is
withdrawn. During the twelve intermediate books it is kept steadily in
view. No interposition takes place but on the part of the specially
authorised agents of Jove, or on that of one or two contumacious
deities, described as boldly setting his commands at defiance, but
checked and reprimanded for their disobedience; while the other divine
warriors, who in the previous and subsequent cantos are so active in
support of their favourite heroes, repeatedly allude to the supreme
edict as the cause of their present inactivity."—Mure, vol. i. p 257.
See however, Muller, "Greek Literature," ch. v. Section 6, and Grote,
vol. ii. p. 252.</p></note>
his balances the fates of both, and affrights the Greeks with his
thunders and lightnings. Nestor alone continues in the field in great
danger: Diomed relieves him; whose exploits, and those of Hector, are
excellently described. Juno endeavours to animate Neptune to the
assistance of the Greeks, but in vain. The acts of Teucer, who is at
length wounded by Hector, and carried off. Juno and Minerva prepare to
aid the Grecians, but are restrained by Iris, sent from Jupiter. The
night puts an end to the battle. Hector continues in the field, (the
Greeks being driven to their fortifications before the ships,) and
gives orders to keep the watch all night in the camp, to prevent the
enemy from re-embarking and escaping by flight. They kindle fires
through all the fields, and pass the night under arms.</p>

<p>The time of seven and twenty days is employed from the opening of the
poem to the end of this book. The scene here (except of the celestial
machines) lies in the field towards the seashore.</p>

<p>"Some of the epithets which Homer applies to the heavens seem to imply
that he considered it as a solid vault of metal. But it is not
necessary to construe these epithets so literally, nor to draw any such
inference from his description of Atlas, who holds the lofty pillars
which keep earth and heaven asunder. Yet it would seem, from the
manner in which the height of heaven is compared with the depth of
Tartarus, that the region of light was thought to have certain bounds.
The summit of the Thessalian Olympus was regarded as the highest point
on the earth, and it is not always carefully distinguished from the
aerian regions above The idea of a seat of the gods—perhaps derived
from a more ancient tradition, in which it was not attached to any
geographical site—seems to be indistinctly blended in the poet's mind
with that of the real mountain."—Thirlwall's Greece, vol. i. p. 217,

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrice turn'd the chief, and thrice imperial Jove</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On Ida's summits thunder'd from above.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Hector heard; he saw the flashing light,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The sign of conquest,) and thus urged the fight:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hear, every Trojan, Lycian, Dardan band,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All famed in war, and dreadful hand to hand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be mindful of the wreaths your arms have won,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your great forefathers' glories, and your own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heard ye the voice of Jove? Success and fame</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Await on Troy, on Greece eternal shame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain they skulk behind their boasted wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Weak bulwarks; destined by this arm to fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High o'er their slighted trench our steeds shall bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pass victorious o'er the levell'd mound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as before yon hollow ships we stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fight each with flames, and toss the blazing brand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till, their proud navy wrapt in smoke and fires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All Greece, encompass'd, in one blaze expires."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Furious he said; then bending o'er the yoke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Encouraged his proud steeds, while thus he spoke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Now, Xanthus, Æthon, Lampus, urge the chase,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thou, Podargus! prove thy generous race;</l>
<pb n="147" /><anchor id="Pg147" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be fleet, be fearless, this important day,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all your master's well-spent care repay.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For this, high-fed, in plenteous stalls ye stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Served with pure wheat, and by a princess' hand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For this my spouse, of great Aetion's line,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So oft has steep'd the strengthening grain in wine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now swift pursue, now thunder uncontroll'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Give me to seize rich Nestor's shield of gold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Tydeus' shoulders strip the costly load,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vulcanian arms, the labour of a god:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These if we gain, then victory, ye powers!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This night, this glorious night, the fleet is ours!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That heard, deep anguish stung Saturnia's soul;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She shook her throne, that shook the starry pole:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus to Neptune: "Thou, whose force can make</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stedfast earth from her foundations shake,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seest thou the Greeks by fates unjust oppress'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor swells thy heart in that immortal breast?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet Ægae, Helice, thy power obey,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Ægae, Helice.</hi> Both these towns were conspicuous for
their worship of Neptune.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gifts unceasing on thine altars lay.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Would all the deities of Greece combine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain the gloomy Thunderer might repine:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sole should he sit, with scarce a god to friend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And see his Trojans to the shades descend:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such be the scene from his Idaean bower;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ungrateful prospect to the sullen power!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Neptune with wrath rejects the rash design:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What rage, what madness, furious queen! is thine?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I war not with the highest. All above</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Submit and tremble at the hand of Jove."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now godlike Hector, to whose matchless might</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove gave the glory of the destined fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Squadrons on squadrons drives, and fills the fields</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With close-ranged chariots, and with thicken'd shields.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where the deep trench in length extended lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Compacted troops stand wedged in firm array,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A dreadful front! they shake the brands, and threat</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With long-destroying flames the hostile fleet.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king of men, by Juno's self inspired,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Toil'd through the tents, and all his army fired.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift as he moved, he lifted in his hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His purple robe, bright ensign of command.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on the midmost bark the king appear'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There, from Ulysses' deck, his voice was heard:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Ajax and Achilles reach'd the sound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose distant ships the guarded navy bound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O Argives! shame of human race! (he cried:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hollow vessels to his voice replied,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where now are all your glorious boasts of yore,</l>
<pb n="148" /><anchor id="Pg148" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your hasty triumphs on the Lemnian shore?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each fearless hero dares a hundred foes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the feast lasts, and while the goblet flows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But who to meet one martial man is found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When the fight rages, and the flames surround?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O mighty Jove! O sire of the distress'd!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Was ever king like me, like me oppress'd?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With power immense, with justice arm'd in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My glory ravish'd, and my people slain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To thee my vows were breathed from every shore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What altar smoked not with our victims' gore?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With fat of bulls I fed the constant flame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And ask'd destruction to the Trojan name.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now, gracious god! far humbler our demand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Give these at least to 'scape from Hector's hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And save the relics of the Grecian land!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus pray'd the king, and heaven's great father heard</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His vows, in bitterness of soul preferr'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wrath appeased, by happy signs declares,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gives the people to their monarch's prayers.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His eagle, sacred bird of heaven! he sent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A fawn his talons truss'd, (divine portent!)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High o'er the wondering hosts he soar'd above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who paid their vows to Panomphaean Jove;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then let the prey before his altar fall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks beheld, and transport seized on all:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Encouraged by the sign, the troops revive,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fierce on Troy with doubled fury drive.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tydides first, of all the Grecian force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er the broad ditch impell'd his foaming horse,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced the deep ranks, their strongest battle tore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dyed his javelin red with Trojan gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Young Agelaus (Phradmon was his sire)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With flying coursers shunn'd his dreadful ire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck through the back, the Phrygian fell oppress'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dart drove on, and issued at his breast:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Headlong he quits the car: his arms resound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His ponderous buckler thunders on the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth rush a tide of Greeks, the passage freed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Atridae first, the Ajaces next succeed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meriones, like Mars in arms renown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And godlike Idomen, now passed the mound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Evaemon's son next issues to the foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And last young Teucer with his bended bow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Secure behind the Telamonian shield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The skilful archer wide survey'd the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With every shaft some hostile victim slew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The conscious infant so, when fear alarms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Retires for safety to the mother's arms.</l>
<pb n="149" /><anchor id="Pg149" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Ajax guards his brother in the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Moves as he moves, and turns the shining shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who first by Teucer's mortal arrows bled?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Orsilochus; then fell Ormenus dead:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The godlike Lycophon next press'd the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With Chromius, Daetor, Ophelestes slain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bold Hamopaon breathless sunk to ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bloody pile great Melanippus crown'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaps fell on heaps, sad trophies of his art,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A Trojan ghost attending every dart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Agamemnon views with joyful eye</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ranks grow thinner as his arrows fly:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O youth forever dear! (the monarch cried)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus, always thus, thy early worth be tried;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy brave example shall retrieve our host,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy country's saviour, and thy father's boast!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from an alien's bed thy sire to grace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proud of his boy, he own'd the generous flame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the brave son repays his cares with fame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now hear a monarch's vow: If heaven's high powers</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Give me to raze Troy's long-defended towers;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whatever treasures Greece for me design,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The next rich honorary gift be thine:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some golden tripod, or distinguished car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With coursers dreadful in the ranks of war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or some fair captive, whom thy eyes approve,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall recompense the warrior's toils with love."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To this the chief: "With praise the rest inspire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor urge a soul already fill'd with fire.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What strength I have, be now in battle tried,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till every shaft in Phrygian blood be dyed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Since rallying from our wall we forced the foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still aim'd at Hector have I bent my bow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eight forky arrows from this hand have fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And eight bold heroes by their points lie dead:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But sure some god denies me to destroy</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This fury of the field, this dog of Troy."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and twang'd the string. The weapon flies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At Hector's breast, and sings along the skies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He miss'd the mark; but pierced Gorgythio's heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And drench'd in royal blood the thirsty dart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Fair Castianira, nymph of form divine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This offspring added to king Priam's line.)</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">So sinks the youth: his beauteous head, depress'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath his helmet, drops upon his breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Another shaft the raging archer drew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That other shaft with erring fury flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(From Hector, Phoebus turn'd the flying wound,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy breast, brave Archeptolemus! it tore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dipp'd its feathers in no vulgar gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Headlong he falls: his sudden fall alarms</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The steeds, that startle at his sounding arms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector with grief his charioteer beheld</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All pale and breathless on the sanguine field:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then bids Cebriones direct the rein,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Quits his bright car, and issues on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dreadful he shouts: from earth a stone he took,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rush'd on Teucer with the lifted rock.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youth already strain'd the forceful yew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shaft already to his shoulder drew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The feather in his hand, just wing'd for flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Touch'd where the neck and hollow chest unite;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There, where the juncture knits the channel bone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The furious chief discharged the craggy stone:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his numb'd hand dismiss'd his useless bow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He fell: but Ajax his broad shield display'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And screen'd his brother with the mighty shade;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till great Alaster, and Mecistheus, bore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The batter'd archer groaning to the shore.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy yet found grace before the Olympian sire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He arm'd their hands, and fill'd their breasts with fire.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First of the foe, great Hector march'd along,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With terror clothed, and more than mortal strong.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As the bold hound, that gives the lion chase,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With beating bosom, and with eager pace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hangs on his haunch, or fastens on his heels,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Guards as he turns, and circles as he wheels;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus oft the Grecians turn'd, but still they flew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus following, Hector still the hindmost slew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When flying they had pass'd the trench profound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And many a chief lay gasping on the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before the ships a desperate stand they made,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fired the troops, and called the gods to aid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce on his rattling chariot Hector came:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That wither'd all their host: like Mars he stood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dire as the monster, dreadful as the god!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their strong distress the wife of Jove survey'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then pensive thus, to war's triumphant maid:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The avenging bolt, and shake the sable shield!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now, in this moment of her last despair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall wretched Greece no more confess our care,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And drain the dregs of heaven's relentless hate?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gods! shall one raging hand thus level all?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What numbers fell! what numbers yet shall fall!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What power divine shall Hector's wrath assuage?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still swells the slaughter, and still grows the rage!"</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh had my wisdom known this dire event,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When to grim Pluto's gloomy gates he went;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The triple dog had never felt his chain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor Styx been cross'd, nor hell explored in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Averse to me of all his heaven of gods,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At Thetis' suit the partial Thunderer nods;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To grace her gloomy, fierce, resenting son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My hopes are frustrate, and my Greeks undone.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some future day, perhaps, he may be moved</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To call his blue-eyed maid his best beloved.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste, launch thy chariot, through yon ranks to ride;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Myself will arm, and thunder at thy side.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, goddess! say, shall Hector glory then?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(That terror of the Greeks, that man of men)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Juno's self, and Pallas shall appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All dreadful in the crimson walks of war!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What mighty Trojan then, on yonder shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Expiring, pale, and terrible no more,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her father's arms her mighty limbs invest,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift as the wind, the various-colour'd maid</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Ida's top her golden wings display'd;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Celestial minds to tempt the wrath of Jove?</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, mounting on the pinions of the wind,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He, whose all-conscious eyes the world behold,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon was your battle o'er: proud Troy retired</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before your face, and in your wrath expired.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unmatch'd our force, unconquer'd is our hand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who shall the sovereign of the skies control?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not all the gods that crown the starry pole.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your hearts shall tremble, if our arms we take,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our common safety must be now the care;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But soon as morning paints the fields of air,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sheathed in bright arms let every troop engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the fired fleet behold the battle rage.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, then shall Hector and Tydides prove</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose fates are heaviest in the scales of Jove.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To-morrow's light (O haste the glorious morn!)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall see his bloody spoils in triumph borne,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With this keen javelin shall his breast be gored,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And prostrate heroes bleed around their lord.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Certain as this, oh! might my days endure,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From age inglorious, and black death secure;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So might my life and glory know no bound,</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.</p>

<p>Agamemnon, after the last day's defeat, proposes to the Greeks to quit
the siege, and return to their country. Diomed opposes this, and Nestor
seconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard to
be strengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what measures are
to be followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, and
Nestor further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in
order to move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice
of, who are accompanied by old Phoenix. They make, each of them, very
moving and pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by
Achilles, who notwithstanding retains Phoenix in his tent. The
ambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake
themselves to sleep.</p>

<p>This book, and the next following, take up the space of one night,
which is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem. The scene
lies on the sea-shore, the station of the Grecian ships.</p>


<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus joyful Troy maintain'd the watch of night;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,<note place="foot"><p>This flight of the Greeks, according to Buttmann, Lexil. p.
358, was not a supernatural flight caused by the gods, but "a great and
general one, caused by Hector and the Trojans, but with the approval of
Jove."</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sat on each face, and sadden'd every heart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A double tempest of the west and north</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swells o'er the sea, from Thracia's frozen shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaps waves on waves, and bids the Ægean roar:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This way and that the boiling deeps are toss'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such various passions urged the troubled host,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Agamemnon grieved above the rest;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Superior sorrows swell'd his royal breast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Himself his orders to the heralds bears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To bid to council all the Grecian peers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But bid in whispers: these surround their chief,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In solemn sadness and majestic grief.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king amidst the mournful circle rose:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.</l>
<pb n="160" /><anchor id="Pg160" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So silent fountains, from a rock's tall head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Words, mix'd with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader's care;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fellows in arms and princes of the war!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of partial Jove too justly we complain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heavenly oracles believed in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A safe return was promised to our toils,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With conquest honour'd and enrich'd with spoils:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now shameful flight alone can save the host;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our wealth, our people, and our glory lost.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Jove decrees, almighty lord of all!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who shakes the feeble props of human trust,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And towers and armies humbles to the dust.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste then, for ever quit these fatal fields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste to the joys our native country yields;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spread all your canvas, all your oars employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: deep silence held the Grecian band;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Silent, unmov'd in dire dismay they stand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A pensive scene! till Tydeus' warlike son</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Roll'd on the king his eyes, and thus begun:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"When kings advise us to renounce our fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First let him speak who first has suffer'd shame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If I oppose thee, prince! thy wrath withhold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The laws of council bid my tongue be bold.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Durst brand my courage, and defame my might:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor from a friend the unkind reproach appear'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks stood witness, all our army heard.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gods have made thee but by halves a king:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They gave thee sceptres, and a wide command;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They gave dominion o'er the seas and land;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">If gifts immense his mighty soul can bow,<note place="foot"><p>In the heroic times, it is not unfrequent for the king to
receive presents to purchase freedom from his wrath, or immunity from
his exactions. Such gifts gradually became regular, and formed the
income of the German, (Tacit. Germ. Section 15) Persian, (Herodot.
iii.89), and other kings. So, too, in the middle ages, 'The feudal aids
are the beginning of taxation, of which they for a long time answered
the purpose.' (Hallam, Middle Ages, ch. x. pt. 1, p. 189) This fact
frees Achilles from the apparent charge of sordidness. Plato, however,
(De Rep. vi. 4), says, "We cannot commend Phoenix, the tutor of
Achilles, as if he spoke correctly, when counselling him to accept of
presents and assist the Greeks, but, without presents, not to desist
from his wrath, nor again, should we commend Achilles himself, or
approve of his being so covetous as to receive presents from
Agamemnon," &amp;c.</p></note></l>

in the Iliad, and small the part she plays—what little is said is
pre-eminently calculated to enhance her fitness to be the bride of
Achilles. Purity, and retiring delicacy, are features well contrasted
with the rough, but tender disposition of the hero.</p></note></l>

Æpais, which receives not only the river Cephisus from the valleys of
Phocis, but also other rivers from Parnassus and Helicon" (Grote, vol.
p. 181), was a sufficient reason for its prosperity and decay. "As
long as the channels of these waters were diligently watched and kept
clear, a large portion of the lake was in the condition of alluvial
land, pre-eminently rich and fertile. But when the channels came to be
either neglected, or designedly choked up by an enemy, the water
accumulated in such a degree as to occupy the soil of more than one
ancient islet, and to occasion the change of the site of Orchomenus
itself from the plain to the declivity of Mount Hyphanteion." (Ibid.)</p></note></l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE NIGHT-ADVENTURE OF DIOMED AND ULYSSES.</p>

<p>Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army, the distress of
Agamemnon is described in the most lively manner. He takes no rest that
night, but passes through the camp, awaking the leaders, and contriving
all possible methods for the public safety. Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses,
and Diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They call
a council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemies' camp,
to learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomed
undertakes this hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for
his companion. In their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had
sent on a like design to the camp of the Grecians. From him they are
informed of the situation of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, and
particularly of Rhesus, and the Thracians who were lately arrived. They
pass on with success; kill Rhesus, with several of his officers, and
seize the famous horses of that prince, with which they return in
triumph to the camp.</p>

<p>The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All night the chiefs before their vessels lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lost in sleep the labours of the day:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All but the king: with various thoughts oppress'd,<note place="foot"><lg>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">With him, in wholesome counsels, to debate</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What yet remains to save the afflicted state.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alike denied the gifts of soft repose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Laments for Greece, that in his cause before</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To wake Atrides in the royal tent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already waked, Atrides he descried,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But say, what hero shall sustain that task?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such bold exploits uncommon courage ask;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Guideless, alone, through night's dark shade to go,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And midst a hostile camp explore the foe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the king: "In such distress we stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No vulgar counsel our affairs demand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece to preserve, is now no easy part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For Jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bows his head to Hector's sacrifice.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What eye has witness'd, or what ear believed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In one great day, by one great arm achieved,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such wondrous deeds as Hector's hand has done,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And we beheld, the last revolving sun</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What honours the beloved of Jove adorn!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from no god, and of no goddess born;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet such his acts, as Greeks unborn shall tell,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And curse the battle where their fathers fell.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ourself to hoary Nestor will repair;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To keep the guards on duty be his care,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">(For Nestor's influence best that quarter guides,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose son with Merion, o'er the watch presides.")</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the Spartan: "These thy orders borne,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Say, shall I stay, or with despatch return?"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"There shall thou stay, (the king of men replied,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Else may we miss to meet, without a guide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The paths so many, and the camp so wide.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Urge by their fathers' fame their future praise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forget we now our state and lofty birth;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not titles here, but works, must prove our worth.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To labour is the lot of man below;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, each parted to his several cares:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king to Nestor's sable ship repairs;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sage protector of the Greeks he found</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd in his bed with all his arms around</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The various-colour'd scarf, the shield he rears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shining helmet, and the pointed spears;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dreadful weapons of the warrior's rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That, old in arms, disdain'd the peace of age.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, leaning on his hand his watchful head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While others sleep, thus range the camp alone;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seek'st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O son of Neleus, (thus the king rejoin'd,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pride of the Greeks, and glory of thy kind!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo, here the wretched Agamemnon stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The unhappy general of the Grecian bands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And woes, that only with his life shall end!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And scarce my heart support its load of pain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confused, and sad, I wander thus alone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With fears distracted, with no fix'd design;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all my people's miseries are mine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Impart thy counsel, and assist thy friend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now let us jointly to the trench descend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At every gate the fainting guard excite,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tired with the toils of day and watch of night;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Else may the sudden foe our works invade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So near, and favour'd by the gloomy shade."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him thus Nestor: "Trust the powers above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor think proud Hector's hopes confirm'd by Jove:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How ill agree the views of vain mankind,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the wise counsels of the eternal mind!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Audacious Hector, if the gods ordain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That great Achilles rise and rage again,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What toils attend thee, and what woes remain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The care is next our other chiefs to raise:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses, Diomed, we chiefly need;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meges for strength, Oileus famed for speed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some other be despatch'd of nimbler feet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">The king of Crete:</hi> Idomeneus.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To rouse the Spartan I myself decree;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dear as he is to us, and dear to thee,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet must I tax his sloth, that claims no share</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With his great brother in his martial care:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him it behoved to every chief to sue,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Preventing every part perform'd by you;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For strong necessity our toils demands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Claims all our hearts, and urges all our hands."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the king: "With reverence we allow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My generous brother is of gentle kind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through too much deference to our sovereign sway,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Content to follow when we lead the way:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But now, our ills industrious to prevent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chiefs you named, already at his call,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prepare to meet us near the navy-wall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Assembling there, between the trench and gates,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Near the night-guards, our chosen council waits."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Then none (said Nestor) shall his rule withstand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For great examples justify command."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With that, the venerable warrior rose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shining greaves his manly legs enclose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His purple mantle golden buckles join'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Warm with the softest wool, and doubly lined.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rushing from his tent, he snatch'd in haste</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His steely lance, that lighten'd as he pass'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stopp'd at Ulysses' tent, and call'd aloud.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses, sudden as the voice was sent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Awakes, starts up, and issues from his tent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What new distress, what sudden cause of fright,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus leads you wandering in the silent night?"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O prudent chief! (the Pylian sage replied)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whatever means of safety can be sought,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whatever counsels can inspire our thought,</l>
<pb n="184" /><anchor id="Pg184" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whatever methods, or to fly or fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All, all depend on this important night!"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He heard, return'd, and took his painted shield;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then join'd the chiefs, and follow'd through the field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Without his tent, bold Diomed they found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All sheathed in arms, his brave companions round:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each sunk in sleep, extended on the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His head reclining on his bossy shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A wood of spears stood by, that, fix'd upright,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shot from their flashing points a quivering light.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A bull's black hide composed the hero's bed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A splendid carpet roll'd beneath his head.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, with his foot, old Nestor gently shakes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Rise, son of Tydeus! to the brave and strong</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rest seems inglorious, and the night too long.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But sleep'st thou now, when from yon hill the foe</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hangs o'er the fleet, and shades our walls below?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though years and honours bid thee seek repose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ill fits thy age these toils to undertake."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"My friend, (he answered,) generous is thy care;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These toils, my subjects and my sons might bear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To ease a sovereign and relieve a sire:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But now the last despair surrounds our host;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No hour must pass, no moment must be lost;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each single Greek, in this conclusive strife,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stands on the sharpest edge of death or life:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet, if my years thy kind regard engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Employ thy youth as I employ my age;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Succeed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He serves me most, who serves his country best."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, the hero o'er his shoulders flung</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A lion's spoils, that to his ankles hung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meges the bold, with Ajax famed for speed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior roused, and to the entrenchments lead.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, couching close, repel invading sleep.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With toil protected from the prowling train;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through breaking woods her rustling course they hear;</l>
<pb n="185" /><anchor id="Pg185" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Watch every side, and turn to every sound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus watch'd the Grecians, cautious of surprise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each step of passing feet increased the affright;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hostile Troy was ever full in sight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nestor with joy the wakeful band survey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus accosted through the gloomy shade.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"'Tis well, my sons! your nightly cares employ;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Else must our host become the scorn of Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Watch thus, and Greece shall live." The hero said;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then o'er the trench the following chieftains led.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His son, and godlike Merion, march'd behind</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(For these the princes to their council join'd).</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The trenches pass'd, the assembled kings around</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In silent state the consistory crown'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A place there was, yet undefiled with gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spot where Hector stopp'd his rage before;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When night descending, from his vengeful hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Reprieved the relics of the Grecian band:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The plain beside with mangled corps was spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all his progress mark'd by heaps of dead:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There sat the mournful kings: when Neleus' son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The council opening, in these words begun:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Is there (said he) a chief so greatly brave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His life to hazard, and his country save?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lives there a man, who singly dares to go</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or favour'd by the night approach so near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If to besiege our navies they prepare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or Troy once more must be the seat of war?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This could he learn, and to our peers recite,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pass unharm'd the dangers of the night;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What fame were his through all succeeding days,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Phoebus shines, or men have tongues to praise!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What gifts his grateful country would bestow!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What must not Greece to her deliverer owe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sable ewe each leader should provide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With each a sable lambkin by her side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At every rite his share should be increased,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his the foremost honours of the feast."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tydides spoke—"The man you seek is here.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some god within commands, and I obey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But let some other chosen warrior join,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To raise my hopes, and second my design.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By mutual confidence and mutual aid,</l>
<pb n="186" /><anchor id="Pg186" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great deeds are done, and great discoveries made;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wise new prudence from the wise acquire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And one brave hero fans another's fire."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Contending leaders at the word arose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each generous breast with emulation glows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So brave a task each Ajax strove to share,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bold Merion strove, and Nestor's valiant heir;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Spartan wish'd the second place to gain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And great Ulysses wish'd, nor wish'd in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus the king of men the contest ends:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Undaunted Diomed! what chief to join</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In this great enterprise, is only thine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Just be thy choice, without affection made;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To birth, or office, no respect be paid;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let worth determine here." The monarch spake,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And inly trembled for his brother's sake.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Then thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin'd)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My choice declares the impulse of my mind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How can I doubt, while great Ulysses stands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To lend his counsels and assist our hands?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A chief, whose safety is Minerva's care;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So famed, so dreadful, in the works of war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bless'd in his conduct, I no aid require;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"It fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Replied the sage,) to praise me, or to blame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Praise from a friend, or censure from a foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Are lost on hearers that our merits know.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But let us haste—Night rolls the hours away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The reddening orient shows the coming day,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And of night's empire but a third remains."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus having spoke, with generous ardour press'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In arms terrific their huge limbs they dress'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A two-edged falchion Thrasymed the brave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And ample buckler, to Tydides gave:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then in a leathern helm he cased his head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Short of its crest, and with no plume o'erspread:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Such as by youths unused to arms are worn:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next him Ulysses took a shining sword,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A bow and quiver, with bright arrows stored:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A well-proved casque, with leather braces bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Thy gift, Meriones,) his temples crown'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soft wool within; without, in order spread,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Soft wool within, i e.</hi> a kind of woollen stuffing,
pressed in between the straps, to protect the head, and make the helmet

<l rend="margin-left: 2">A boar's white teeth grinn'd horrid o'er his head.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This from Amyntor, rich Ormenus' son,</l>
<pb n="187" /><anchor id="Pg187" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Autolycus by fraudful rapine won,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gave Amphidamas; from him the prize</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Molus received, the pledge of social ties;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The helmet next by Merion was possess'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now Ulysses' thoughtful temples press'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus sheathed in arms, the council they forsake,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dark through paths oblique their progress take.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Just then, in sign she favour'd their intent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A long-wing'd heron great Minerva sent:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This, though surrounding shades obscured their view.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As from the right she soar'd, Ulysses pray'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hail'd the glad omen, and address'd the maid:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O daughter of that god whose arm can wield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O thou! for ever present in my way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who all my motions, all my toils survey!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe by thy succour to our ships convey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And let some deed this signal night adorn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To claim the tears of Trojans yet unborn."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then godlike Diomed preferr'd his prayer:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Daughter of Jove, unconquer'd Pallas! hear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great queen of arms, whose favour Tydeus won,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thou defend'st the sire, defend the son.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When on Æsopus' banks the banded powers</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of Greece he left, and sought the Theban towers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Peace was his charge; received with peaceful show,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He went a legate, but return'd a foe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then help'd by thee, and cover'd by thy shield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He fought with numbers, and made numbers yield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So now be present, O celestial maid!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So still continue to the race thine aid!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Untamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With ample forehead, and with spreading horns,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The heroes pray'd, and Pallas from the skies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Accords their vow, succeeds their enterprise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now, like two lions panting for the prey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through dust, through blood, o'er arms, and hills of slain.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">On high designs the wakeful hours employ;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who thus the counsels of his breast proposed:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What glorious man, for high attempts prepared,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dares greatly venture for a rich reward?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of yonder fleet a bold discovery make,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">What watch they keep, and what resolves they take?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If now subdued they meditate their flight,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">His the fair steeds that all the rest excel,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his the glory to have served so well."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A youth there was among the tribes of Troy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dolon his name, Eumedes' only boy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Five girls beside the reverend herald told.)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rich was the son in brass, and rich in gold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not bless'd by nature with the charms of face,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But swift of foot, and matchless in the race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hector! (he said) my courage bids me meet</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This high achievement, and explore the fleet:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But first exalt thy sceptre to the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And swear to grant me the demanded prize;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The immortal coursers, and the glittering car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That bear Pelides through the ranks of war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Encouraged thus, no idle scout I go,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fulfil thy wish, their whole intention know,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even to the royal tent pursue my way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all their counsels, all their aims betray."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Attesting thus the monarch of the sky:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Be witness thou! immortal lord of all!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By none but Dolon shall this prize be borne,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And him alone the immortal steeds adorn."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Hector swore: the gods were call'd in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But the rash youth prepares to scour the plain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Across his back the bended bow he flung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A wolf's grey hide around his shoulders hung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A ferret's downy fur his helmet lined,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in his hand a pointed javelin shined.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then (never to return) he sought the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And trod the path his feet must tread no more.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce had he pass'd the steeds and Trojan throng,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Still bending forward as he coursed along,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When, on the hollow way, the approaching tread</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses mark'd, and thus to Diomed;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O friend! I hear some step of hostile feet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Moving this way, or hastening to the fleet;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or nightly pillager that strips the slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet let him pass, and win a little space;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rush behind him, and prevent his pace.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But if too swift of foot he flies before,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confine his course along the fleet and shore,</l>
<pb n="189" /><anchor id="Pg189" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Betwixt the camp and him our spears employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And intercept his hoped return to Troy."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With that they stepp'd aside, and stoop'd their head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(As Dolon pass'd,) behind a heap of dead:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Along the path the spy unwary flew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So distant they, and such the space between,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when two teams of mules divide the green,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(To whom the hind like shares of land allows,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector (he thought) had sent, and check'd his haste,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till scarce at distance of a javelin's throw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now lost, now seen, they intercept his way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from the herd still turn the flying prey:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And mingles with the guards that watch the walls;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When brave Tydides stopp'd; a gen'rous thought</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And snatch the glory from his lifted lance.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus aloud: "Whoe'er thou art, remain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and high in air the weapon cast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which wilful err'd, and o'er his shoulder pass'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then fix'd in earth. Against the trembling wood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wretch stood propp'd, and quiver'd as he stood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sudden palsy seized his turning head;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His loose teeth chatter'd, and his colour fled;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The panting warriors seize him as he stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And with unmanly tears his life demands.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O spare my youth, and for the breath I owe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Large gifts of price my father shall bestow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And steel well-temper'd and refulgent gold."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom Ulysses made this wise reply:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Whoe'er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What moves thee, say, when sleep has closed the sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To roam the silent fields in dead of night?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Cam'st thou the secrets of our camp to find,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Hector prompted, or thy daring mind?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through heaps of carnage, to despoil the dead?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus pale Dolon, with a fearful look:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Still, as he spoke, his limbs with horror shook:)</l>
<pb n="190" /><anchor id="Pg190" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hither I came, by Hector's words deceived;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Much did he promise, rashly I believed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No less a bribe than great Achilles' car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Urged me, unwilling, this attempt to make;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To learn what counsels, what resolves you take:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If now subdued, you fix your hopes on flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, tired with toils, neglect the watch of night."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Bold was thy aim, and glorious was the prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Ulysses, with a scornful smile, replies,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far other rulers those proud steeds demand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even great Achilles scarce their rage can tame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles sprung from an immortal dame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But say, be faithful, and the truth recite!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where lies encamp'd the Trojan chief to-night?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where stand his coursers? in what quarter sleep</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their other princes? tell what watch they keep:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Say, since this conquest, what their counsels are;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or here to combat, from their city far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or back to Ilion's walls transfer the war?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses thus, and thus Eumedes' son:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What Dolon knows, his faithful tongue shall own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector, the peers assembling in his tent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A council holds at Ilus' monument.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No certain guards the nightly watch partake;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where'er yon fires ascend, the Trojans wake:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Anxious for Troy, the guard the natives keep;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe in their cares, the auxiliar forces sleep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose wives and infants, from the danger far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Discharge their souls of half the fears of war."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Then sleep those aids among the Trojan train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Inquired the chief,) or scattered o'er the plain?"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the spy: "Their powers they thus dispose</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Paeons, dreadful with their bended bows,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rich silver plates his shining car infold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His solid arms, refulgent, flame with gold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No mortal shoulders suit the glorious load,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Celestial panoply, to grace a god!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let me, unhappy, to your fleet be borne,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The truth or falsehood of the news I tell."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To this Tydides, with a gloomy frown:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Think not to live, though all the truth be shown:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall we dismiss thee, in some future strife</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To risk more bravely thy now forfeit life?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or that again our camps thou may'st explore?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No—once a traitor, thou betray'st no more."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sternly he spoke, and as the wretch prepared</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With humble blandishment to stroke his beard,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Divides the neck, and cuts the nerves in two;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One instant snatch'd his trembling soul to hell,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The head, yet speaking, mutter'd as it fell.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The furry helmet from his brow they tear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wolf's grey hide, the unbended bow and spear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These great Ulysses lifting to the skies,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thee, first of all the heavenly host, we praise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O speed our labours, and direct our ways!"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, the spoils, with dropping gore defaced,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on a spreading tamarisk he placed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then heap'd with reeds and gathered boughs the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guide their footsteps to the place again.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the still night they cross the devious fields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Slippery with blood, o'er arms and heaps of shields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arriving where the Thracian squadrons lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And eased in sleep the labours of the day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The horses yoked beside each warrior stand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their arms in order on the ground reclined,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amidst lay Rhesus, stretch'd in sleep profound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the white steeds behind his chariot bound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The welcome sight Ulysses first descries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And points to Diomed the tempting prize.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"The man, the coursers, and the car behold!</l>

buried in a profound sleep, and Diomede with the sword in his hand
hanging over the head of that prince—furnished Homer with the idea of
this fiction, which represents Rhesus lying fast asleep, and, as it
were, beholding his enemy in a dream, plunging the sword into his
bosom. This image is very natural; for a man in his condition awakes no
farther than to see confusedly what environs him, and to think it not a
reality but a dream."—Pope.</p>

<p>ARGUMENT</p>

<p>THE THIRD BATTLE, AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON.</p>

<p>Agamemnon, having armed himself, leads the Grecians to battle; Hector
prepares the Trojans to receive them, while Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva
give the signals of war. Agamemnon bears all before him and Hector is
commanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that purpose) to decline the
engagement, till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field.
He then makes a great slaughter of the enemy. Ulysses and Diomed put a
stop to him for a time but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is
obliged to desert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans,
wounded, and in the utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him.
Hector comes against Ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes, and
rallies the Greeks. In the meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the
army, is pierced with an arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in
Nestor's chariot. Achilles (who overlooked the action from his ship)
sent Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded in that
manner; Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the
accidents of the day, and a long recital of some former wars which he
remembered, tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles to fight
for his countrymen, or at least to permit him to do it, clad in
Achilles' armour. Patroclus, on his return, meets Eurypylus also
wounded, and assists him in that distress.</p>

<p>This book opens with the eight and-twentieth day of the poem, and the
same day, with its various actions and adventures is extended through
the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth,
and part of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in the field near the
monument of Ilus.</p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The path they take, and speed to reach the town.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As swift, Atrides with loud shouts pursued,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hot with his toil, and bathed in hostile blood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now near the beech-tree, and the Scaean gates,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero halts, and his associates waits.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile on every side around the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dispersed, disorder'd, fly the Trojan train.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lion's roaring through the midnight shade;</l>
<pb n="201" /><anchor id="Pg201" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On heaps they tumble with successless haste;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not with less fury stem Atrides flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still press'd the rout, and still the hindmost slew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hurl'd from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rage, and death, and carnage load the field.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now storms the victor at the Trojan wall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Surveys the towers, and meditates their fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Jove descending shook the Idaean hills,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And down their summits pour'd a hundred rills:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The unkindled lightning in his hand he took,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus the many-coloured maid bespoke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Iris, with haste thy golden wings display,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To godlike Hector this our word convey—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bid him give way; but issue forth commands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And trust the war to less important hands:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Jove shall string his arm, and fire his breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then to her ships shall flying Greece be press'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till to the main the burning sun descend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sacred night her awful shade extend."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and Iris at his word obey'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On wings of winds descends the various maid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief she found amidst the ranks of war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close to the bulwarks, on his glittering car.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The goddess then: "O son of Priam, hear!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Jove I come, and his high mandate bear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Abstain from fight; yet issue forth commands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And trust the war to less important hands:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Jove shall string thy arm, and fire thy breast,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She said, and vanish'd. Hector, with a bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Springs from his chariot on the trembling ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In clanging arms: he grasps in either hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A pointed lance, and speeds from band to band;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They stand to arms: the Greeks their onset dare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Condense their powers, and wait the coming war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">New force, new spirit, to each breast returns;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fight renew'd with fiercer fury burns:</l>
<pb n="202" /><anchor id="Pg202" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king leads on: all fix on him their eye,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And learn from him to conquer, or to die.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ye sacred nine! celestial Muses! tell,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who faced him first, and by his prowess fell?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great Iphidamas, the bold and young,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From sage Antenor and Theano sprung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom from his youth his grandsire Cisseus bred,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And nursed in Thrace where snowy flocks are fed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And early honour warm his generous breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When the kind sire consign'd his daughter's charms</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Theano's sister) to his youthful arms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But call'd by glory to the wars of Troy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He leaves untasted the first fruits of joy;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his loved bride departs with melting eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And swift to aid his dearer country flies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With twelve black ships he reach'd Percope's strand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thence took the long laborious march by land.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Towering in arms, and braves the king of kings.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Atrides first discharged the missive spear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojan stoop'd, the javelin pass'd in air.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then near the corslet, at the monarch's heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With all his strength, the youth directs his dart:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But the broad belt, with plates of silver bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The point rebated, and repell'd the wound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Encumber'd with the dart, Atrides stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till, grasp'd with force, he wrench'd it from his hands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once his weighty sword discharged a wound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on his neck, that fell'd him to the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd in the dust the unhappy warrior lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh worthy better fate! oh early slain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy country's friend; and virtuous, though in vain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more the youth shall join his consort's side,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once a virgin, and at once a bride!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more with presents her embraces meet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or lay the spoils of conquest at her feet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On whom his passion, lavish of his store,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bestow'd so much, and vainly promised more!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unwept, uncover'd, on the plain he lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the proud victor bore his arms away.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Coon, Antenor's eldest hope, was nigh:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tears, at the sight, came starting from his eye,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the pale features now deform'd with blood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, with his spear, unseen, his time he took,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Aim'd at the king, and near his elbow strook.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.</l>
<pb n="203" /><anchor id="Pg203" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Surprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On Coon rushes with his lifted spear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His brother's corpse the pious Trojan draws,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And calls his country to assert his cause;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Defends him breathless on the sanguine field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And o'er the body spreads his ample shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Atrides, marking an unguarded part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Transfix'd the warrior with his brazen dart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone on his brother's bleeding breast he lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The monarch's falchion lopp'd his head away:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The social shades the same dark journey go,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And join each other in the realms below.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The vengeful victor rages round the fields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With every weapon art or fury yields:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whole ranks are broken, and whole troops o'erthrown.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This, while yet warm distill'd the purple flood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Less keen those darts the fierce Ilythiae send:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The powers that cause the teeming matron's throes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sad mothers of unutterable woes!)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stung with the smart, all-panting with the pain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He mounts the car, and gives his squire the rein;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then with a voice which fury made more strong,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O friends! O Greeks! assert your honours won;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proceed, and finish what this arm begun:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! angry Jove forbids your chief to stay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And envies half the glories of the day."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: the driver whirls his lengthful thong;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The horses fly; the chariot smokes along.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Clouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from their sides the foam descends in snow;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shot through the battle in a moment's space,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wounded monarch at his tent they place.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No sooner Hector saw the king retired,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But thus his Trojans and his aids he fired:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hear, all ye Dardan, all ye Lycian race!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Famed in close fight, and dreadful face to face:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now call to mind your ancient trophies won,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your great forefathers' virtues, and your own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold, the general flies! deserts his powers!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo, Jove himself declares the conquest ours!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, sure of glory, dare immortal deeds."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Writh words like these the fiery chief alarms</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fainting host, and every bosom warms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brindled lion, or the tusky bear:</l>
<pb n="204" /><anchor id="Pg204" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With voice and hand provokes their doubting heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And springs the foremost with his lifted dart:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So godlike Hector prompts his troops to dare;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor prompts alone, but leads himself the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On the black body of the foe he pours;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As from the cloud's deep bosom, swell'd with showers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Say, Muse! when Jove the Trojan's glory crown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Assaeus, Dolops, and Autonous died,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Opites next was added to their side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then brave Hipponous, famed in many a fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Opheltius, Orus, sunk to endless night;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Æsymnus, Agelaus; all chiefs of name;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when a western whirlwind, charged with storms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dispels the gather'd clouds that Notus forms:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gust continued, violent and strong,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now to the skies the foaming billows rears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now breaks the surge, and wide the bottom bares:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus, raging Hector, with resistless hands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'erturns, confounds, and scatters all their bands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now the last ruin the whole host appals;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now Greece had trembled in her wooden walls;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But wise Ulysses call'd Tydides forth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His soul rekindled, and awaked his worth.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"And stand we deedless, O eternal shame!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till Hector's arm involve the ships in flame?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste, let us join, and combat side by side."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior thus, and thus the friend replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"No martial toil I shun, no danger fear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let Hector come; I wait his fury here.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Jove with conquest crowns the Trojan train:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, Jove our foe, all human force is vain."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sigh'd; but, sighing, raised his vengeful steel,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from his car the proud Thymbraeus fell:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Molion, the charioteer, pursued his lord,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His death ennobled by Ulysses' sword.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There slain, they left them in eternal night,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So two wild boars outstrip the following hounds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then swift revert, and wounds return for wounds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern Hector's conquests in the middle plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stood check'd awhile, and Greece respired again.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sons of Merops shone amidst the war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Towering they rode in one refulgent car:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In deep prophetic arts their father skill'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had warn'd his children from the Trojan field.</l>
<pb n="205" /><anchor id="Pg205" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fate urged them on: the father warn'd in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They rush'd to fight, and perish'd on the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their breasts no more the vital spirit warms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stern Tydides strips their shining arms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hypirochus by great Ulysses dies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rich Hippodamus becomes his prize.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Jove from Ide with slaughter fills his sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And level hangs the doubtful scale of fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Tydeus' lance Agastrophus was slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The far-famed hero of Paeonian strain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wing'd with his fears, on foot he strove to fly,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through broken orders, swifter than the wind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He fled, but flying left his life behind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This Hector sees, as his experienced eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Traverse the files, and to the rescue flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shouts, as he pass'd, the crystal regions rend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And moving armies on his march attend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Diomed himself was seized with fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus bespoke his brother of the war:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The storm rolls on, and Hector rules the field:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here stand his utmost force."—The warrior said;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor miss'd its aim, but where the plumage danced</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Razed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe in his helm (the gift of Phoebus' hands)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Without a wound the Trojan hero stands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But yet so stunn'd, that, staggering on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er his dim sight the misty vapours rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And a short darkness shades his swimming eyes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tydides followed to regain his lance;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Hector rose, recover'd from the trance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Remounts his car, and herds amidst the crowd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greek pursues him, and exults aloud:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Once more thank Phoebus for thy forfeit breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Well by Apollo are thy prayers repaid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And oft that partial power has lent his aid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou shall not long the death deserved withstand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If any god assist Tydides' hand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fly then, inglorious! but thy flight, this day,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay,"</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him, while he triumph'd, Paris eyed from far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The spouse of Helen, the fair cause of war;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around the fields his feather'd shafts he sent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From ancient Ilus' ruin'd monument:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behind the column placed, he bent his bow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wing'd an arrow at the unwary foe;</l>
<pb n="206" /><anchor id="Pg206" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Just as he stoop'd, Agastrophus's crest</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To seize, and drew the corslet from his breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bowstring twang'd; nor flew the shaft in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But pierced his foot, and nail'd it to the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The laughing Trojan, with a joyful spring.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Leaps from his ambush, and insults the king.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"He bleeds! (he cries) some god has sped my dart!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Would the same god had fix'd it in his heart!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Troy, relieved from that wide-wasting hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose sons now tremble at his darted spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As scatter'd lambs the rushing lion fear."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He dauntless thus: "Thou conqueror of the fair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou woman-warrior with the curling hair;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain archer! trusting to the distant dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unskill'd in arms to act a manly part!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou hast but done what boys or women can;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such hands may wound, but not incense a man.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A coward's weapon never hurts the brave.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so this dart, which thou may'st one day feel;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fate wings its flight, and death is on the steel:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where this but lights, some noble life expires;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Its touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And leaves such objects as distract the fair."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses hastens with a trembling heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before him steps, and bending draws the dart:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now on the field Ulysses stands alone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks all fled, the Trojans pouring on;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But stands collected in himself, and whole,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And questions thus his own unconquer'd soul:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What further subterfuge, what hopes remain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What danger, singly if I stand the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My friends all scatter'd, all the foes around?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brave meets danger, and the coward flies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To die or conquer, proves a hero's heart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, knowing this, I know a soldier's part."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such thoughts revolving in his careful breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Near, and more near, the shady cohorts press'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These, in the warrior, their own fate enclose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And round him deep the steely circle grows.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He grinds his ivory tusks; he foams with ire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire;</l>
<pb n="207" /><anchor id="Pg207" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By these, by those, on every part is plied;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the red slaughter spreads on every side.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Chersidamas, beneath the navel thrust,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Falls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Charops, the son of Hippasus, was near;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses reach'd him with the fatal spear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But to his aid his brother Socus flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Socus the brave, the generous, and the wise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Near as he drew, the warrior thus began:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O great Ulysses! much-enduring man!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not deeper skill'd in every martial sleight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Than worn to toils, and active in the fight!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And end at once the great Hippasian race,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or thou beneath this lance must press the field."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Plough'd half his side, and bared it to the bone.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Pallas' care, the spear, though deep infix'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stopp'd short of life, nor with his entrails mix'd.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Unhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fate calls thee hence and finish'd is thy race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor longer check my conquests on the foe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And add one spectre to the realms below!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, while Socus, seized with sudden fright,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Trembling gave way, and turn'd his back to flight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Between his shoulders pierced the following dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And held its passage through the panting heart:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wide in his breast appear'd the grisly wound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He falls; his armour rings against the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Famed son of Hippasus! there press the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There ends thy narrow span assign'd by fate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah, wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy dying eyes no tender mother close;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But hungry birds shall tear those balls away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hovering vultures scream around their prey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Me Greece shall honour, when I meet my doom,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With solemn funerals and a lasting tomb."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then raging with intolerable smart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He writhes his body, and extracts the dart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gladden'd Troy with sight of hostile blood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now troops on troops the fainting chief invade,</l>
<pb n="208" /><anchor id="Pg208" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forced he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alarm'd, to Ajax Telamon he cried,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who shares his labours, and defends his side:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O friend! Ulysses' shouts invade my ear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Distressed he seems, and no assistance near;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Strong as he is, yet one opposed to all,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oppress'd by multitudes, the best may fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece robb'd of him must bid her host despair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And feel a loss not ages can repair."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, where the cry directs, his course he bends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Ajax, like the god of war, attends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prudent chief in sore distress they found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With bands of furious Trojans compass'd round.<note place="foot"><lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Circled with foes as when a packe of bloodie jackals cling</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">About a goodly palmed hart, hurt with a hunter's bow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose escape his nimble feet insure, whilst his warm blood doth flow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his light knees have power to move: but (maistred by his wound)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Embost within a shady hill, the jackals charge him round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And teare his flesh—when instantly fortune sends in the powers</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of some sterne lion, with whose sighte they flie and he devours.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So they around Ulysses prest."</l>
</lg>

<p rend="text-align: right">—Chapman.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when some huntsman, with a flying spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the blind thicket wounds a stately deer;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Down his cleft side, while fresh the blood distils,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till life's warm vapour issuing through the wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lion rushes through the woodland shade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lordly savage vindicates his prey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses thus, unconquer'd by his pains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A single warrior half a host sustains:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But soon as Ajax leaves his tower-like shield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The scattered crowds fly frighted o'er the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Atrides' arm the sinking hero stays,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, saved from numbers, to his car conveys.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Victorious Ajax plies the routed crew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And first Doryclus, Priam's son, he slew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when a torrent, swell'd with wintry rains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pours from the mountains o'er the deluged plains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pines and oaks, from their foundations torn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A country's ruins! to the seas are borne:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce Ajax thus o'erwhelms the yielding throng;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Hector, from this scene of slaughter far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Raged on the left, and ruled the tide of war:</l>
<pb n="209" /><anchor id="Pg209" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There Nestor and Idomeneus oppose</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior's fury; there the battle glows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There fierce on foot, or from the chariot's height,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spouse of Helen, dealing darts around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had pierced Machaon with a distant wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In his right shoulder the broad shaft appear'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And trembling Greece for her physician fear'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Nestor then Idomeneus begun:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Glory of Greece, old Neleus' valiant son!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ascend thy chariot, haste with speed away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And great Machaon to the ships convey;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A wise physician skill'd our wounds to heal,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is more than armies to the public weal."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Old Nestor mounts the seat; beside him rode</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wounded offspring of the healing god.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But now Cebriones, from Hector's car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Survey'd the various fortune of the war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"While here (he cried) the flying Greeks are slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Trojans on Trojans yonder load the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before great Ajax see the mingled throng</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of men and chariots driven in heaps along!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I know him well, distinguish'd o'er the field</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thither, O Hector, thither urge thy steeds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There danger calls, and there the combat bleeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There horse and foot in mingled deaths unite,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus having spoke, the driver's lash resounds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The horses' hoofs are bathed in heroes' gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, dashing, purple all the car before;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The groaning axle sable drops distils,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here Hector, plunging through the thickest fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ranks he scatter'd and the troops o'erthrown:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fears that arm whose force he felt so late.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But partial Jove, espousing Hector's part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian's heart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confused, unnerved in Hector's presence grown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amazed he stood, with terrors not his own.</l>
<pb n="210" /><anchor id="Pg210" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er his broad back his moony shield he threw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus the grim lion his retreat maintains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though rage impels him, and though hunger calls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long stands the showering darts, and missile fires;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then sourly slow the indignant beast retires:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So turn'd stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While his swoln heart at every step rebell'd.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In some wide field by troops of boys pursued,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though round his sides a wooden tempest rain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thick on his hide the hollow blows resound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The patient animal maintains his ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce from the field with all their efforts chased,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confiding now in bulky strength he stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And threats his followers with retorted eye.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd as the bar between two warring powers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While hissing darts descend in iron showers:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In his broad buckler many a weapon stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Its surface bristled with a quivering wood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose eager javelin launch'd against the foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his torn liver the red current flow'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his slack knees desert their dying load.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The victor rushing to despoil the dead,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Paris' bow a vengeful arrow fled;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd was the point, but broken was the wood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Back to the lines the wounded Greek retired,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet thus retreating, his associates fired:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay'd?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh, turn to arms; 'tis Ajax claims your aid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And this the last brave battle he shall wage:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior rescue, and your country save."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus urged the chief: a generous troop appears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,</l>
<pb n="211" /><anchor id="Pg211" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With pious care, great Ajax joins the band:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each takes new courage at the hero's sight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero rallies, and renews the fight.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus raged both armies like conflicting fires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Nestor's chariot far from fight retires:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His coursers steep'd in sweat, and stain'd with gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks' preserver, great Machaon, bore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That hour Achilles, from the topmost height</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of his proud fleet, o'erlook'd the fields of fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His feasted eyes beheld around the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His friend Machaon singled from the rest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A transient pity touch'd his vengeful breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Straight to Menoetius' much-loved son he sent:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Graceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In evil hour! Then fate decreed his doom,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fix'd the date of all his woes to come.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Why calls my friend? thy loved injunctions lay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whate'er thy will, Patroclus shall obey."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O first of friends! (Pelides thus replied)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still at my heart, and ever at my side!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The time is come, when yon despairing host</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall learn the value of the man they lost:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moan,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And proud Atrides tremble on his throne.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go now to Nestor, and from him be taught</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What wounded warrior late his chariot brought:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For, seen at distance, and but seen behind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His form recall'd Machaon to my mind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor could I, through yon cloud, discern his face,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The coursers pass'd me with so swift a pace."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero said. His friend obey'd with haste,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through intermingled ships and tents he pass'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chiefs descending from their car he found:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The panting steeds Eurymedon unbound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warriors standing on the breezy shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here paused a moment, while the gentle gale</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Convey'd that freshness the cool seas exhale;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then to consult on farther methods went,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And took their seats beneath the shady tent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The draught prescribed, fair Hecamede prepares,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arsinous' daughter, graced with golden hairs:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Whom to his aged arms, a royal slave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece, as the prize of Nestor's wisdom gave:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A table first with azure feet she placed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose ample orb a brazen charger graced;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Honey new-press'd, the sacred flour of wheat,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wholesome garlic, crown'd the savoury treat,</l>
<pb n="212" /><anchor id="Pg212" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next her white hand an antique goblet brings,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From eldest times: emboss'd with studs of gold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two feet support it, and four handles hold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On each bright handle, bending o'er the brink,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When the brisk nectar overlook'd the brim.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Temper'd in this, the nymph of form divine</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pours a large portion of the Pramnian wine;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With goat's-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And last with flour the smiling surface strows:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This for the wounded prince the dame prepares:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Salubrious draughts the warriors' thirst allay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pleasing conference beguiles the day.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime Patroclus, by Achilles sent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unheard approached, and stood before the tent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Old Nestor, rising then, the hero led</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To his high seat: the chief refused and said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"'Tis now no season for these kind delays;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great Achilles with impatience stays.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To great Achilles this respect I owe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who asks, what hero, wounded by the foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With grief I see the great Machaon bleeds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This to report, my hasty course I bend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou know'st the fiery temper of my friend."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Can then the sons of Greece (the sage rejoin'd)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Excite compassion in Achilles' mind?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seeks he the sorrows of our host to know?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This is not half the story of our woe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tell him, not great Machaon bleeds alone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our bravest heroes in the navy groan,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses, Agamemnon, Diomed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stern Eurypylus, already bleed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But, ah! what flattering hopes I entertain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles heeds not, but derides our pain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even till the flames consume our fleet he stays,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And waits the rising of the fatal blaze.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Chief after chief the raging foe destroys;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Calm he looks on, and every death enjoys.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now the slow course of all-impairing time</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh! had I still that strength my youth possess'd,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">If some dire oracle his breast alarm,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If aught from Heaven withhold his saving arm,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE BATTLE AT THE GRECIAN WALL.</p>

<p>The Greeks having retired into their intrenchments, Hector attempts to
force them; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch, Polydamas
advises to quit their chariots, and manage the attack on foot. The
Trojans follow his counsel; and having divided their army into five
bodies of foot, begin the assault. But upon the signal of an eagle with
a serpent in his talons, which appeared on the left hand of the
Trojans, Polydamas endeavours to withdraw them again. This Hector
opposes, and continues the attack; in which, after many actions,
Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall. Hector also, casting a
stone of vast size, forces open one of the gates, and enters at the
head of his troops, who victoriously pursue the Grecians even to their
ships.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thus the hero's pious cares attend</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The cure and safety of his wounded friend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With gods averse the ill-fated works arose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their powers neglected, and no victim slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Without the gods, how short a period stands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The proudest monument of mortal hands!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This stood while Hector and Achilles raged.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While sacred Troy the warring hosts engaged;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when her sons were slain, her city burn'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And what survived of Greece to Greece return'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Neptune and Apollo shook the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ida's summits pour'd their watery store;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Caresus roaring down the stony hills,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now smooth'd with sand, and levell'd by the flood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No fragment tells where once the wonder stood;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But this the gods in later times perform;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The strokes yet echoed of contending powers;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">War thunder'd at the gates, and blood distain'd the towers.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Smote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector's approach in every wind they hear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Hector's fury every moment fear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He, like a whirlwind, toss'd the scattering throng,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mingled the troops, and drove the field along.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So 'midst the dogs and hunters' daring bands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arm'd foes around a dreadful circle form,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hissing javelins rain an iron storm:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His powers untamed, their bold assault defy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And where he turns the rout disperse or die:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And if he falls, his courage makes him fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With equal rage encompass'd Hector glows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The panting steeds impatient fury breathe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eager they view'd the prospect dark and deep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bottom bare, (a formidable show!)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bristled thick with sharpen'd stakes below.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The foot alone this strong defence could force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And try the pass impervious to the horse.</l>
<pb n="219" /><anchor id="Pg219" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Restrain'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No pass through those, without a thousand wounds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No space for combat in yon narrow bounds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proud of the favours mighty Jove has shown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On certain dangers we too rashly run:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If 'tis will our haughty foes to tame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh may this instant end the Grecian name!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here, far from Argos, let their heroes fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And one great day destroy and bury all!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But should they turn, and here oppress our train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What hopes, what methods of retreat remain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In one promiscuous carnage crush'd and bruised,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All Troy must perish, if their arms prevail,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Back from the trenches let your steeds be led;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then all alighting, wedged in firm array,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proceed on foot, and Hector lead the way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Greece shall stoop before our conquering power,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And this (if Jove consent) her fatal hour."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next him, the bravest, at their army's head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But he more brave than all the hosts he led.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now with compacted shields in close array,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The moving legions speed their headlong way:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already in their hopes they fire the fleet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And see the Grecians gasping at their feet.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While every Trojan thus, and every aid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The advice of wise Polydamas obey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Asius alone, confiding in his car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unhappy hero! and advised in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those wheels returning ne'er shall mark the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more those coursers with triumphant joy</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Restore their master to the gates of Troy!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Black death attends behind the Grecian wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce to the left he drives, where from the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gates half-open'd to receive the last.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thither, exulting in his force, he flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His following host with clamours rend the skies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who from the Lapiths' warlike race descend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This Polypoetes, great Perithous' heir,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And that Leonteus, like the god of war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As two tall oaks, before the wall they rise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forbid the tempest, and protect the ground;</l>
<pb n="221" /><anchor id="Pg221" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on the hills appears their stately form,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And their deep roots for ever brave the storm.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So graceful these, and so the shock they stand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of raging Asius, and his furious band.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Orestes, Acamas, in front appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And OEnomaus and Thoon close the rear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain around them beat their hollow shields;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fearless brothers on the Grecians call,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guard their navies, and defend the wall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even when they saw Troy's sable troops impend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Greece tumultuous from her towers descend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth from the portals rush'd the intrepid pair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So two wild boars spring furious from their den,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On every side the crackling trees they tear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around their heads the whistling javelins sung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With sounding strokes their brazen targets rung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Maintain'd the walls, and mann'd the lofty towers:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To save their fleet their last efforts they try,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dreary winter on his frozen wings;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Descend, and whiten all the fields below:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So fast the darts on either army pour,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So down the rampires rolls the rocky shower:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heavy, and thick, resound the batter'd shields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the deaf echo rattles round the fields.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"In powers immortal who shall now believe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Can those too flatter, and can Jove deceive?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What man could doubt but Troy's victorious power</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should humble Greece, and this her fatal hour?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guard the entrance of their common hive,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Darkening the rock, while with unwearied wings</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They strike the assailants, and infix their stings;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A race determined, that to death contend:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gods! shall two warriors only guard their gates,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Repel an army, and defraud the fates?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These empty accents mingled with the wind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor moved great Jove's unalterable mind;</l>
<pb n="222" /><anchor id="Pg222" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To godlike Hector and his matchless might</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Was owed the glory of the destined fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all the gates sustain'd an equal tide;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the long walls the stony showers were heard,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spirit of a god my breast inspire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To raise each act to life, and sing with fire!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Greece unconquer'd kept alive the war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Secure of death, confiding in despair;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With unassisting arms deplored the day.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First Damasus, by Polypoetes' steel,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced through his helmet's brazen visor, fell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First through the belt Hippomachus he gored,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then sudden waved his unresisted sword:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antiphates, as through the ranks he broke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Iamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And round him rose a monument of dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bold Hector and Polydamas, pursue;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce with impatience on the works to fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These on the farther bank now stood and gazed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Heaven alarm'd, by prodigies amazed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A signal omen stopp'd the passing host,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their martial fury in their wonder lost.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove's bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A bleeding serpent of enormous size,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His talons truss'd; alive, and curling round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In airy circles wings his painful way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Floats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amidst the host the fallen serpent lies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Jove's portent with beating hearts behold.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then first Polydamas the silence broke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long weigh'd the signal, and to Hector spoke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For words well meant, and sentiments sincere?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">True to those counsels which I judge the best,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I tell the faithful dictates of my breast.</l>
<pb n="223" /><anchor id="Pg223" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To speak his thoughts is every freeman's right,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In peace, in war, in council, and in fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all I move, deferring to thy sway,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But tends to raise that power which I obey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then hear my words, nor may my words be vain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For sure, to warn us, Jove his omen sent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus my mind explains its clear event:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The victor eagle, whose sinister flight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dismiss'd his conquest in the middle skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Allow'd to seize, but not possess the prize;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus, though we gird with fires the Grecian fleet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Toils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">More woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For thus a skilful seer would read the skies."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him then Hector with disdain return'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Fierce as he spoke, his eyes with fury burn'd:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy will is partial, not thy reason wrong:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What coward counsels would thy madness move</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against the word, the will reveal'd of Jove?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The leading sign, the irrevocable nod,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And happy thunders of the favouring god,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These shall I slight, and guide my wavering mind</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By wandering birds that flit with every wind?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ye vagrants of the sky! your wings extend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or where the suns arise, or where descend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To right, to left, unheeded take your way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While I the dictates of high heaven obey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Without a sign his sword the brave man draws,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And asks no omen but his country's cause.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But why should'st thou suspect the war's success?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">None fears it more, as none promotes it less:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy and her sons may find a general grave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet should the fears that wary mind suggests</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spread their cold poison through our soldiers' breasts,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My javelin can revenge so base a part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And free the soul that quivers in thy heart."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Furious he spoke, and, rushing to the wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Calls on his host; his host obey the call;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With ardour follow where their leader flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Redoubling clamours thunder in the skies.</l>
<pb n="224" /><anchor id="Pg224" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And drifts of dust the clouded navy hide;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He fills the Greeks with terror and dismay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gives great Hector the predestined day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Strong in themselves, but stronger in his aid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close to the works their rigid siege they laid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain the mounds and massy beams defend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While these they undermine, and those they rend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shield touching shield, a long refulgent row;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bold Ajaces fly from tower to tower,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rouse, with flame divine, the Grecian power.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The generous impulse every Greek obeys;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Threats urge the fearful; and the valiant, praise.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Fellows in arms! whose deeds are known to fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And you, whose ardour hopes an equal name!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Since not alike endued with force or art;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold a day when each may act his part!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A day to fire the brave, and warm the cold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To gain new glories, or augment the old.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Urge those who stand, and those who faint, excite;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drown Hector's vaunts in loud exhorts of fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Conquest, not safety, fill the thoughts of all;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seek not your fleet, but sally from the wall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Jove once more may drive their routed train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Troy lie trembling in her walls again."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now the stones descend in heavier showers.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when high Jove his sharp artillery forms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And opes his cloudy magazine of storms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In winter's bleak un comfortable reign,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A snowy inundation hides the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And first the mountain-tops are cover'd o'er,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then the green fields, and then the sandy shore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And one bright waste hides all the works of men:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The circling seas, alone absorbing all,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So from each side increased the stony rain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the white ruin rises o'er the plain.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus godlike Hector and his troops contend</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To force the ramparts, and the gates to rend:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor Troy could conquer, nor the Greeks would yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till great Sarpedon tower'd amid the field;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">For mighty Jove inspired with martial flame</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His matchless son, and urged him on to fame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In arms he shines, conspicuous from afar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bears aloft his ample shield in air;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Within whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ponderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And while two pointed javelins arm his hands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Majestic moves along, and leads his Lycian bands.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So press'd with hunger, from the mountain's brow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Descends a lion on the flocks below;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So stalks the lordly savage o'er the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In sullen majesty, and stern disdain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And shepherds gall him with an iron war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Regardless, furious, he pursues his way;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Resolved alike, divine Sarpedon glows</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With generous rage that drives him on the foes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He views the towers, and meditates their fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then casting on his friend an ardent look,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fired with the thirst of glory, thus he spoke:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their strength, united, best may help to bear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bloody labours of the doubtful war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hither the Lycian princes bend their course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The best and bravest of the hostile force.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But if too fiercely there the foes contend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let Telamon, at least, our towers defend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Teucer haste with his unerring bow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To share the danger, and repel the foe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift, at the word, the herald speeds along</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Opposed in combat on the dusty shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your aid (said Thoos) Peteus' son demands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your strength, united, best may help to bear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bloody labours of the doubtful war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thither the Lycian princes bend their course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The best and bravest of the hostile force.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But if too fiercely, here, the foes contend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At least, let Telamon those towers defend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Teucer haste with his unerring bow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To share the danger, and repel the foe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Straight to the fort great Ajax turn'd his care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus bespoke his brothers of the war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Now, valiant Lycomede! exert your might,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, brave Oileus, prove your force in fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To you I trust the fortune of the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till by this arm the foe shall be repell'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That done, expect me to complete the day</l>
<pb n="227" /><anchor id="Pg227" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then with his sevenfold shield he strode away.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With equal steps bold Teucer press'd the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on the walls appear'd the Lycian powers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like some black tempest gathering round the towers:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks, oppress'd, their utmost force unite,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prepared to labour in the unequal fight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The war renews, mix'd shouts and groans arise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce Ajax first the advancing host invades,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sends the brave Epicles to the shades,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sarpedon's friend. Across the warrior's way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In modern ages not the strongest swain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He poised, and swung it round; then toss'd on high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It flew with force, and labour'd up the sky;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the Lycian's helmet thundering down,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ponderous ruin crush'd his batter'd crown.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As skilful divers from some airy steep</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Headlong descend, and shoot into the deep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So falls Epicles; then in groans expires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And murmuring to the shades the soul retires.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Teucer's hand a winged arrow flew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bearded shaft the destined passage found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And on his naked arm inflicts a wound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief, who fear'd some foe's insulting boast</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Might stop the progress of his warlike host,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Conceal'd the wound, and, leaping from his height</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Retired reluctant from the unfinish'd fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Divine Sarpedon with regret beheld</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Disabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His beating breast with generous ardour glows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alcmaon first was doom'd his force to feel;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then from the yawning wound with fury tore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His brazen armour rings against the ground.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift to the battlement the victor flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tugs with full force, and every nerve applies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rolling ruins smoke along the field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, like a deluge, rushes in the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd in his belt the feather'd weapon stood,</l>
<pb n="228" /><anchor id="Pg228" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And through his buckler drove the trembling wood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Jove was present in the dire debate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To shield his offspring, and avert his fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prince gave back, not meditating flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But urging vengeance, and severer fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then raised with hope, and fired with glory's charms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fainting squadrons to new fury warms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your former fame and ancient virtue lost!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The breach lies open, but your chief in vain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Attempts alone the guarded pass to gain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The force of powerful union conquers all."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They join, they thicken, and the assault renew:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fix'd support the weight of all the war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As on the confines of adjoining grounds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One foot, one inch, of the contended field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The copious slaughter covers all the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the high ramparts drip with human gore.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From side to side the trembling balance nods,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(While some laborious matron, just and poor,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With nice exactness weighs her woolly store,)</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">So stood the war, till Hector's matchless might,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With fates prevailing, turn'd the scale of fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE FOURTH BATTLE CONTINUED, IN WHICH NEPTUNE ASSISTS THE GREEKS:
THE ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.</p>

<p>Neptune, concerned for the loss of the Grecians, upon seeing the
fortification forced by Hector, (who had entered the gate near the
station of the Ajaces,) assumes the shape of Calchas, and inspires
those heroes to oppose him: then, in the form of one of the generals,
encourages the other Greeks who had retired to their vessels. The
Ajaces form their troops in a close phalanx, and put a stop to Hector
and the Trojans. Several deeds of valour are performed; Meriones,
losing his spear in the encounter, repairs to seek another at the tent
of Idomeneus: this occasions a conversation between those two warriors,
who return together to the battle. Idomeneus signalizes his courage
above the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and Alcathous: Deiphobus
and Æneas march against him, and at length Idomeneus retires. Menelaus
wounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The Trojans are repulsed on the
left wing; Hector still keeps his ground against the Ajaces, till,
being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas advises to
call a council of war: Hector approves of his advice, but goes first to
rally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax again,
and renews the attack.</p>

<p>The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the
Grecian wall and the sea-shore.</p>


<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coast</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had fix'd great Hector and his conquering host,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He left them to the fates, in bloody fray</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To toil and struggle through the well-fought day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then turn'd to Thracia from the field of fight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those eyes that shed insufferable light,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To where the Mysians prove their martial force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hardy Thracians tame the savage horse;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And where the far-famed Hippomolgian strays,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Renown'd for justice and for length of days;<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Renown'd for justice and for length of days,</hi> Arrian.
de Exp. Alex. iv. p. 239, also speaks of the independence of these
people, which he regards as the result of their poverty and
uprightness. Some authors have regarded the phrase "Hippomolgian,"
<hi rend="font-style: italic">i.e.</hi> "milking their mares," as an epithet applicable to numerous
tribes, since the oldest of the Samatian nomads made their mares' milk
one of their chief articles of diet. The epithet abion or abion, in
this passage, has occasioned much discussion. It may mean, according as
we read it, either "long-lived," or "bowless," the latter epithet
indicating that they did not depend upon archery for subsistence.</p></note></l>
<pb n="231" /><anchor id="Pg231" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrice happy race! that, innocent of blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From milk, innoxious, seek their simple food:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove sees delighted; and avoids the scene</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of guilty Troy, of arms, and dying men:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No aid, he deems, to either host is given,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While his high law suspends the powers of Heaven.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime the monarch of the watery main</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Observed the Thunderer, nor observed in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In Samothracia, on a mountain's brow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose waving woods o'erhung the deeps below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sat; and round him cast his azure eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where Ida's misty tops confusedly rise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Below, fair Ilion's glittering spires were seen;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The crowded ships and sable seas between.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There, from the crystal chambers of the main</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Emerged, he sat, and mourn'd his Argives slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At Jove incensed, with grief and fury stung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone down the rocky steep he rush'd along;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce as he pass'd, the lofty mountains nod,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The forest shakes; earth trembled as he trod,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And felt the footsteps of the immortal god.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From realm to realm three ample strides he took,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, at the fourth, the distant Ægae shook.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far in the bay his shining palace stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eternal frame! not raised by mortal hands:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This having reach'd, his brass-hoof'd steeds he reins,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fleet as the winds, and deck'd with golden manes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Immortal arms of adamant and gold.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He mounts the car, the golden scourge applies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sits superior, and the chariot flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The enormous monsters rolling o'er the deep</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gambol around him on the watery way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heavy whales in awkward measures play;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sea subsiding spreads a level plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Exults, and owns the monarch of the main;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The parting waves before his coursers fly;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wondering waters leave his axle dry.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep in the liquid regions lies a cave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Between where Tenedos the surges lave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rocky Imbrus breaks the rolling wave:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There the great ruler of the azure round</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stopp'd his swift chariot, and his steeds unbound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And link'd their fetlocks with a golden band,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Infrangible, immortal: there they stay:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The father of the floods pursues his way:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where, like a tempest, darkening heaven around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or fiery deluge that devours the ground,</l>
<pb n="232" /><anchor id="Pg232" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The impatient Trojans, in a gloomy throng,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Embattled roll'd, as Hector rush'd along:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the loud tumult and the barbarous cry</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The heavens re-echo, and the shores reply:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They vow destruction to the Grecian name,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in their hopes the fleets already flame.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Neptune, rising from the seas profound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now wears a mortal form; like Calchas seen,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such his loud voice, and such his manly mien;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His shouts incessant every Greek inspire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But most the Ajaces, adding fire to fire.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But breathe new courage as they feel the power.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Teucer and Leitus first his words excite;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said; and roused the soul in every breast:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before his wary steps his ample shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bold Merion aim'd a stroke (nor aim'd it wide);</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But pierced not through: unfaithful to his hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The point broke short, and sparkled in the sand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojan warrior, touch'd with timely fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On the raised orb to distance bore the spear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greek, retreating, mourn'd his frustrate blow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then to the ships with surly speed he went,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To seek a surer javelin in his tent.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Teucer's arm the warlike Imbrius bleeds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Mentor, rich in generous steeds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ere yet to Troy the sons of Greece were led,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In fair Pedaeus' verdant pastures bred,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youth had dwelt, remote from war's alarms,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Troy, when glory call'd his arms, he came,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And match'd the bravest of her chiefs in fame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With Priam's sons, a guardian of the throne,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He lived, beloved and honour'd as his own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him Teucer pierced between the throat and ear:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">As from some far-seen mountain's airy crown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Subdued by steel, a tall ash tumbles down,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And soils its verdant tresses on the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So falls the youth; his arms the fall resound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Teucer rushing to despoil the dead,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Hector's hand a shining javelin fled:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He saw, and shunn'd the death; the forceful dart</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain was his courage, and his race divine!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prostrate he falls; his clanging arms resound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his broad buckler thunders on the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To seize his beamy helm the victor flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And just had fastened on the dazzling prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Ajax' manly arm a javelin flung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the shield's round boss the weapon rung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He felt the shock, nor more was doom'd to feel,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Repulsed he yields; the victor Greeks obtain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spoils contested, and bear off the slain.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the king: "On Greece no blame be thrown;</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, he rushes where the combat burns;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift to his tent the Cretan king returns:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From thence, two javelins glittering in his hand,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And were some ambush for the foes design'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even there thy courage would not lag behind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In that sharp service, singled from the rest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fear of each, or valour, stands confess'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No force, no firmness, the pale coward shows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He shifts his place: his colour comes and goes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A dropping sweat creeps cold on every part;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against his bosom beats his quivering heart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Terror and death in his wild eye-balls stare;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With chattering teeth he stands, and stiffening hair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And looks a bloodless image of despair!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so the brave—still dauntless, still the same,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unchanged his colour, and unmoved his frame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Composed his thought, determined is his eye,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fix'd his soul, to conquer or to die:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If aught disturb the tenour of his breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis but the wish to strike before the rest.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"In such assays thy blameless worth is known,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And every art of dangerous war thy own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By chance of fight whatever wounds you bore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those wounds were glorious all, and all before;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such as may teach, 'twas still thy brave delight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">T'oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But why, like infants, cold to honour's charms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stand we to talk, when glory calls to arms?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go—from my conquer'd spears the choicest take,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And to their owners send them nobly back."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift at the word bold Merion snatch'd a spear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, breathing slaughter, follow'd to the war.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The pride of haughty warriors to confound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lay the strength of tyrants on the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Thrace they fly, call'd to the dire alarms</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of warring Phlegyans, and Ephyrian arms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Invoked by both, relentless they dispose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To these glad conquest, murderous rout to those.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So march'd the leaders of the Cretan train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And their bright arms shot horror o'er the plain.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then first spake Merion: "Shall we join the right,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or combat in the centre of the fight?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or to the left our wonted succour lend?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hazard and fame all parts alike attend."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or bear close battle on the sounding shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These can the rage of haughty Hector tame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe in their arms, the navy fears no flame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till Jove himself descends, his bolts to shed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hurl the blazing ruin at our head.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great must he be, of more than human birth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him neither rocks can crush, nor steel can wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom Ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In standing fight he mates Achilles' force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Excell'd alone in swiftness in the course.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: and Merion to th' appointed place,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce as the god of battles, urged his pace.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rush like a fiery torrent o'er the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their force embodied in a tide they pour;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rising combat sounds along the shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As warring winds, in Sirius' sultry reign,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From different quarters sweep the sandy plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On every side the dusty whirlwinds rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the dry fields are lifted to the skies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus by despair, hope, rage, together driven,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Met the black hosts, and, meeting, darken'd heaven.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All dreadful glared the iron face of war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bristled with upright spears, that flash'd afar;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dire was the gleam of breastplates, helms, and shields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And polish'd arms emblazed the flaming fields:</l>
<pb n="240" /><anchor id="Pg240" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tremendous scene! that general horror gave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But touch'd with joy the bosoms of the brave.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Saturn's great sons in fierce contention vied,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And crowds of heroes in their anger died.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sire of earth and heaven, by Thetis won</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To crown with glory Peleus' godlike son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Will'd not destruction to the Grecian powers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But spared awhile the destined Trojan towers;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Neptune, rising from his azure main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Warr'd on the king of heaven with stern disdain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And breathed revenge, and fired the Grecian train.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gods of one source, of one ethereal race,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alike divine, and heaven their native place;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Jove the greater; first-born of the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And more than men, or gods, supremely wise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For this, of Jove's superior might afraid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Neptune in human form conceal'd his aid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These powers enfold the Greek and Trojan train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In war and discord's adamantine chain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Indissolubly strong: the fatal tie</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is stretch'd on both, and close compell'd they die.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dreadful in arms, and grown in combats grey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bold Idomeneus controls the day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First by his hand Othryoneus was slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swell'd with false hopes, with mad ambition vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Call'd by the voice of war to martial fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From high Cabesus' distant walls he came;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Cassandra's love he sought, with boasts of power,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And promised conquest was the proffer'd dower.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king consented, by his vaunts abused;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king consented, but the fates refused.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proud of himself, and of the imagined bride,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The field he measured with a larger stride.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him as he stalk'd, the Cretan javelin found;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain was his breastplate to repel the wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His dream of glory lost, he plunged to hell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His arms resounded as the boaster fell.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great Idomeneus bestrides the dead;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"And thus (he cries) behold thy promise sped!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such is the help thy arms to Ilion bring,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To conquer Troy, with ours thy forces join,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Come, follow to the fleet thy new allies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There hear what Greece has on her part to say."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and dragg'd the gory corse away.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This Asius view'd, unable to contain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before his chariot warring on the plain:</l>
<pb n="241" /><anchor id="Pg241" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(His crowded coursers, to his squire consign'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Impatient panted on his neck behind:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To vengeance rising with a sudden spring,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He hoped the conquest of the Cretan king.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wary Cretan, as his foe drew near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on his throat discharged the forceful spear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath the chin the point was seen to glide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And glitter'd, extant at the further side.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when the mountain-oak, or poplar tall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or pine, fit mast for some great admiral,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Groans to the oft-heaved axe, with many a wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then spreads a length of ruin o'er the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So sunk proud Asius in that dreadful day,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stretch'd before his much-loved coursers lay.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He grinds the dust distain'd with streaming gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stands all aghast his trembling charioteer,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But falls transfix'd, an unresisting prey:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced by Antilochus, he pants beneath</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stately car, and labours out his breath.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Asius' steeds (their mighty master gone)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Remain the prize of Nestor's youthful son.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stabb'd at the sight, Deiphobus drew nigh,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Cretan saw; and, stooping, caused to glance</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his slope shield the disappointed lance.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath the spacious targe, (a blazing round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thick with bull-hides and brazen orbits bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On his raised arm by two strong braces stay'd,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He lay collected in defensive shade.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er his safe head the javelin idly sung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And on the tinkling verge more faintly rung.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even then the spear the vigorous arm confess'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pierced, obliquely, king Hypsenor's breast:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Warm'd in his liver, to the ground it bore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief, his people's guardian now no more!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Not unattended (the proud Trojan cries)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor unrevenged, lamented Asius lies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For thee, through hell's black portals stand display'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This mate shall joy thy melancholy shade."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heart-piercing anguish, at the haughty boast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Touch'd every Greek, but Nestor's son the most.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Grieved as he was, his pious arms attend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his broad buckler shields his slaughter'd friend:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till sad Mecistheus and Alastor bore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His honour'd body to the tented shore.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor yet from fight Idomeneus withdraws;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Resolved to perish in his country's cause,</l>
<pb n="242" /><anchor id="Pg242" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or find some foe, whom heaven and he shall doom</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To wail his fate in death's eternal gloom.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sees Alcathous in the front aspire:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Æsyetes was the hero's sire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His spouse Hippodame, divinely fair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Anchises' eldest hope, and darling care:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who charm'd her parents' and her husband's heart</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With beauty, sense, and every work of art:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He once of Ilion's youth the loveliest boy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fairest she of all the fair of Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Neptune now the hapless hero dies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fetters every limb: yet bent to meet</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fate he stands; nor shuns the lance of Crete.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd as some column, or deep-rooted oak,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the winds sleep; his breast received the stroke.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before the ponderous stroke his corslet yields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long used to ward the death in fighting fields.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The riven armour sends a jarring sound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The long lance shakes, and vibrates in the wound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fast flowing from its source, as prone he lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Life's purple tide impetuous gush'd away.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Idomen, insulting o'er the slain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Behold, Deiphobus! nor vaunt in vain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">See! on one Greek three Trojan ghosts attend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This, my third victim, to the shades I send.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Approaching now thy boasted might approve,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And try the prowess of the seed of Jove.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Jove, enamour'd of a mortal dame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Minos, guardian of his country, came:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deucalion, blameless prince, was Minos' heir;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His first-born I, the third from Jupiter:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er spacious Crete, and her bold sons, I reign,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thence my ships transport me through the main:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lord of a host, o'er all my host I shine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A scourge to thee, thy father, and thy line."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojan heard; uncertain or to meet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alone, with venturous arms the king of Crete,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or seek auxiliar force; at length decreed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To call some hero to partake the deed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forthwith Æneas rises to his thought:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For him in Troy's remotest lines he sought,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where he, incensed at partial Priam, stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sees superior posts in meaner hands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him, ambitious of so great an aid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bold Deiphobus approach'd, and said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Now, Trojan prince, employ thy pious arms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If e'er thy bosom felt fair honour's charms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alcathous dies, thy brother and thy friend;</l>
<pb n="243" /><anchor id="Pg243" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Come, and the warrior's loved remains defend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath his cares thy early youth was train'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One table fed you, and one roof contain'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This deed to fierce Idomeneus we owe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste, and revenge it on th' insulting foe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Æneas heard, and for a space resign'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To tender pity all his manly mind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rising in his rage, he burns to fight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greek awaits him with collected might.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As the fell boar, on some rough mountain's head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arm'd with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When the loud rustics rise, and shout from far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Attends the tumult, and expects the war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er his bent back the bristly horrors rise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His foaming tusks both dogs and men engage;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But most his hunters rouse his mighty rage:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So stood Idomeneus, his javelin shook,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And met the Trojan with a lowering look.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antilochus, Deipyrus, were near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youthful offspring of the god of war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Merion, and Aphareus, in field renown'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To these the warrior sent his voice around.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Fellows in arms! your timely aid unite;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo, great Æneas rushes to the fight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from a god, and more than mortal bold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He fresh in youth, and I in arms grown old.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Else should this hand, this hour decide the strife,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great dispute, of glory, or of life."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around the chief. Æneas too demands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Th' assisting forces of his native bands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, join;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In order follow all th' embodied train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like Ida's flocks proceeding o'er the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before his fleecy care, erect and bold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With joy the swain surveys them, as he leads</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So joys Æneas, as his native band</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Moves on in rank, and stretches o'er the land.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Round dread Alcathous now the battle rose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On every side the steely circle grows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now batter'd breast-plates and hack'd helmets ring,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And o'er their heads unheeded javelins sing.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Above the rest, two towering chiefs appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There great Idomeneus, Æneas here.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,</l>
<pb n="244" /><anchor id="Pg244" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And burn'd to drench the ground with mutual blood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojan weapon whizz'd along in air;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Cretan saw, and shunn'd the brazen spear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sent from an arm so strong, the missive wood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stuck deep in earth, and quiver'd where it stood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But OEnomas received the Cretan's stroke;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It ripp'd his belly with a ghastly wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And roll'd the smoking entrails on the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd on the plain, he sobs away his breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The victor from his breast the weapon tears;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though now unfit an active war to wage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His listless limbs unable for the course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In standing fight he yet maintains his force;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till faint with labour, and by foes repell'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His tired slow steps he drags from off the field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deiphobus beheld him as he pass'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The javelin err'd, but held its course along,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Mars fell gasping on the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gnash'd the dust, all bloody with his wound.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor knew the furious father of his fall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High-throned amidst the great Olympian hall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On golden clouds th' immortal synod sate;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Detain'd from bloody war by Jove and Fate.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now, where in dust the breathless hero lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deiphobus to seize his helmet flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from his temples rends the glittering prize;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Valiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And on his loaded arm discharged his spear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He drops the weight, disabled with the pain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hollow helmet rings against the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift as a vulture leaping on his prey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his torn arm the Grecian rent away</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The reeking javelin, and rejoin'd his friends.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His wounded brother good Polites tends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around his waist his pious arms he threw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from the rage of battle gently drew:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him his swift coursers, on his splendid car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rapt from the lessening thunder of the war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sprinkling, as he pass'd, the sands with gore.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath his helmet, nods upon his breast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His shield reversed o'er the fallen warrior lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And everlasting slumber seals his eyes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antilochus, as Thoon turn'd him round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Transpierced his back with a dishonest wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hollow vein, that to the neck extends</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Along the chine, his eager javelin rends:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Supine he falls, and to his social train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Th' exulting victor, leaping where he lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his broad shoulders tore the spoils away;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His time observed; for closed by foes around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On all sides thick the peals of arms resound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His shield emboss'd the ringing storm sustains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But he impervious and untouch'd remains.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Great Neptune's care preserved from hostile rage</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And blunts the javelin of th' eluded foe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In the broad buckler half the weapon stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Splinter'd on earth flew half the broken wood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Disarm'd, he mingled in the Trojan crew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Merion's spear o'ertook him as he flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep in the belly's rim an entrance found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bending he fell, and doubled to the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lay panting. Thus an ox in fetters tied,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While death's strong pangs distend his labouring side,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His bulk enormous on the field displays;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spear the conqueror from his body drew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And death's dim shadows swarm before his view.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next brave Deipyrus in dust was laid:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">King Helenus waved high the Thracian blade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And smote his temples with an arm so strong,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The helm fell off, and roll'd amid the throng:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There for some luckier Greek it rests a prize;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For dark in death the godlike owner lies!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Raging with grief, great Menelaus burns,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns:</l>
<pb n="246" /><anchor id="Pg246" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And this stood adverse with the bended bow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on his breast the Trojan arrow fell,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But harmless bounded from the plated steel.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As on some ample barn's well harden'd floor,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The winds collected at each open door,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the broad fan with force is whirl'd around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Light leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So from the steel that guards Atrides' heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Repell'd to distance flies the bounding dart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Atrides, watchful of the unwary foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced with his lance the hand that grasp'd the bow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And nailed it to the yew: the wounded hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Trail'd the long lance that mark'd with blood the sand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But good Agenor gently from the wound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spear solicits, and the bandage bound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sling's soft wool, snatch'd from a soldier's side,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once the tent and ligature supplied.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold! Pisander, urged by fate's decree,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Springs through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Menelaus! to enchance thy fame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High-towering in the front, the warrior came.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lance far distant by the winds was blown.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor pierced Pisander through Atrides' shield:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pisander's spear fell shiver'd on the field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so discouraged, to the future blind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dauntless he rushes where the Spartan lord</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like lightning brandish'd his far beaming sword.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His left arm high opposed the shining shield:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His right beneath, the cover'd pole-axe held;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(An olive's cloudy grain the handle made,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Distinct with studs, and brazen was the blade;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This on the helm discharged a noble blow;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The plume dropp'd nodding to the plain below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shorn from the crest. Atrides waved his steel:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep through his front the weighty falchion fell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The crashing bones before its force gave way;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In dust and blood the groaning hero lay:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fierce Atrides spurn'd him as he bled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tore off his arms, and, loud-exulting, said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thus, Trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O race perfidious, who delight in war!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already noble deeds ye have perform'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A princess raped transcends a navy storm'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In such bold feats your impious might approve,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Without th' assistance, or the fear of Jove.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our heroes slaughter'd and our ships on flame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Crimes heap'd on crimes, shall bend your glory down,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O thou, great father! lord of earth and skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Above the thought of man, supremely wise!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If from thy hand the fates of mortals flow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From whence this favour to an impious foe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A godless crew, abandon'd and unjust,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still breathing rapine, violence, and lust?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The best of things, beyond their measure, cloy;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sleep's balmy blessing, love's endearing joy;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The feast, the dance; whate'er mankind desire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Troy for ever reaps a dire delight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, he seized (while yet the carcase heaved)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bloody armour, which his train received:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then sudden mix'd among the warring crew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the bold son of Pylaemenes slew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Harpalion had through Asia travell'd far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Following his martial father to the war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through filial love he left his native shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Never, ah, never to behold it more!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against the target of the Spartan king;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus of his lance disarm'd, from death he flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And turns around his apprehensive eyes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him, through the hip transpiercing as he fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shaft of Merion mingled with the dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath the bone the glancing point descends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, driving down, the swelling bladder rends:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sunk in his sad companions' arms he lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in short pantings sobb'd his soul away;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Like some vile worm extended on the ground;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While life's red torrent gush'd from out the wound.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him on his car the Paphlagonian train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In slow procession bore from off the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The pensive father, father now no more!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Attends the mournful pomp along the shore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And unavailing tears profusely shed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, unrevenged, deplored his offspring dead.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Paris from far the moving sight beheld,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And loved of all the Paphlagonian race!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With his full strength he bent his angry bow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wing'd the feather'd vengeance at the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A chief there was, the brave Euchenor named,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For riches much, and more for virtue famed.</l>
<pb n="248" /><anchor id="Pg248" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who held his seat in Corinth's stately town;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Polydus' son, a seer of old renown.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oft had the father told his early doom,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By arms abroad, or slow disease at home:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He climb'd his vessel, prodigal of breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And chose the certain glorious path to death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath his ear the pointed arrow went;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The soul came issuing at the narrow vent:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And everlasting darkness shades him round.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor knew great Hector how his legions yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Wrapp'd in the cloud and tumult of the field:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wide on the left the force of Greece commands,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">With such a tide superior virtue sway'd,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And where low walls confine the beating tides,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose humble barrier scarce the foe divides;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where late in fight both foot and horse engaged,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all the thunder of the battle raged,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There join'd, the whole Boeotian strength remains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The proud Iaonians with their sweeping trains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Locrians and Phthians, and th' Epaean force;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But join'd, repel not Hector's fiery course.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flower of Athens, Stichius, Phidas, led;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bias and great Menestheus at their head:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meges the strong the Epaean bands controll'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Dracius prudent, and Amphion bold:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Phthians, Medon, famed for martial might,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And brave Podarces, active in the fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This drew from Phylacus his noble line;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Iphiclus' son: and that (Oileus) thine:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now side by side, with like unwearied care,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Join'd to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And trace large furrows with the shining share;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.</l>
<pb n="249" /><anchor id="Pg249" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A train of heroes followed through the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who bore by turns great Ajax' sevenfold shield;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whene'er he breathed, remissive of his might,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No following troops his brave associate grace:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In close engagement an unpractised race,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But skill'd from far the flying shaft to wing,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dexterous with these they aim a certain wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or fell the distant warrior to the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus in the van the Telamonian train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Throng'd in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far in the rear the Locrian archers lie,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose stones and arrows intercept the sky,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mingled tempest on the foes they pour;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy's scattering orders open to the shower.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now had the Greeks eternal fame acquired,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But sage Polydamas, discreetly brave,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Though great in all, thou seem'st averse to lend</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Impartial audience to a faithful friend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To gods and men thy matchless worth is known,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And every art of glorious war thy own;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But in cool thought and counsel to excel,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How widely differs this from warring well!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Content with what the bounteous gods have given,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seek not alone to engross the gifts of Heaven.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To some the powers of bloody war belong,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To some sweet music and the charm of song;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To few, and wondrous few, has Jove assign'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A wise, extensive, all-considering mind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their guardians these, the nations round confess,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And towns and empires for their safety bless.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Attend, O Hector! what I judge the best,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">See, as thou mov'st, on dangers dangers spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And war's whole fury burns around thy head.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold! distress'd within yon hostile wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What troops, out-number'd, scarce the war maintain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Convoked to council, weigh the sum of things.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whether (the gods succeeding our desires)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Contented with the conquest of the day.</l>
<pb n="250" /><anchor id="Pg250" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">On yonder decks, and yet o'erlooks the plains!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The counsel pleased; and Hector, with a bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Leap'd from his chariot on the trembling ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift as he leap'd his clanging arms resound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"To guard this post (he cried) thy art employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And here detain the scatter'd youth of Troy;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where yonder heroes faint, I bend my way,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through all his host, inspiring force, he flies,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Panthus' son, at Hector's high command</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste the bold leaders of the Trojan band:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some cold in death, some groaning on the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some low in dust, (a mournful object) lay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on the wall some breathed their souls away.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far on the left, amid the throng he found</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Cheering the troops, and dealing deaths around)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The graceful Paris; whom, with fury moved,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Opprobrious thus, th' impatient chief reproved:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ill-fated Paris! slave to womankind,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But 'tis not ours, with forces not our own</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To combat: strength is of the gods alone."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These words the hero's angry mind assuage:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around Polydamas, distain'd with blood,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like Mars commission'd to confound mankind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before him flaming his enormous shield,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus stalk'd he, dreadful; death was in his look:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whole nations fear'd; but not an Argive shook.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The towering Ajax, with an ample stride,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Advanced the first, and thus the chief defied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hector! come on; thy empty threats forbear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis not thy arm, 'tis thundering Jove we fear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The skill of war to us not idly given,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! Greece is humbled, not by Troy, but Heaven.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To force our fleet: the Greeks have hands and hearts.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long ere in flames our lofty navy fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your boasted city, and your god-built wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall sink beneath us, smoking on the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And spread a long unmeasured ruin round.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The time shall come, when, chased along the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even thou shalt call on Jove, and call in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even thou shalt wish, to aid thy desperate course,</l>
<pb n="252" /><anchor id="Pg252" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wings of falcons for thy flying horse;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shalt run, forgetful of a warrior's fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thus he spoke, behold, in open view,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On sounding wings a dexter eagle flew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Jove's glad omen all the Grecians rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hail, with shouts, his progress through the skies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far-echoing clamours bound from side to side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They ceased; and thus the chief of Troy replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"From whence this menace, this insulting strain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Enormous boaster! doom'd to vaunt in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So may the gods on Hector life bestow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Not that short life which mortals lead below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But such as those of Jove's high lineage born,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The blue-eyed maid, or he that gilds the morn,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As this decisive day shall end the fame</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of Greece, and Argos be no more a name.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thou, imperious! if thy madness wait</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lance of Hector, thou shalt meet thy fate:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That giant-corse, extended on the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said; and like a lion stalk'd along:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With shouts incessant earth and ocean rung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sent from his following host: the Grecian train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With answering thunders fill'd the echoing plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A shout that tore heaven's concave, and, above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shook the fix'd splendours of the throne of Jove.</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.<note place="foot"><p>This book forms a most agreeable interruption to
The continuous round of battles, which occupy the latter part of the
Iliad. It is as well to observe, that the sameness of these scenes
renders many notes unnecessary.</p></note></p>

<p>JUNO DECEIVES JUPITER BY THE GIRDLE OF VENUS.</p>

<p>Nestor, sitting at the table with Machaon, is alarmed with the
increasing clamour of war, and hastens to Agamemnon; on his way he
meets that prince with Diomed and Ulysses, whom he informs of the
extremity of the danger. Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by
night, which Ulysses withstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, that,
wounded as they were, they should go forth and encourage the army with
their presence, which advice is pursued. Juno, seeing the partiality of
Jupiter to the Trojans, forms a design to over-reach him: she sets off
her charms with the utmost care, and (the more surely to enchant him)
obtains the magic girdle of Venus. She then applies herself to the god
of sleep, and, with some difficulty, persuades him to seal the eyes of
Jupiter: this done, she goes to mount Ida, where the god, at first
sight, is ravished with her beauty, sinks in her embraces, and is laid
asleep. Neptune takes advantage of his slumber, and succours the
Greeks: Hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by Ajax,
and carried off from the battle: several actions succeed, till the
Trojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way: the lesser Ajax
signalizes himself in a particular manner.</p>


<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Could charm the cares of Nestor's watchful soul;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His startled ears the increasing cries attend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus, impatient, to his wounded friend:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What new alarm, divine Machaon, say,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What mix'd events attend this mighty day?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hark! how the shouts divide, and how they meet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now come full, and thicken to the fleet!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here with the cordial draught dispel thy care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Refresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While I the adventures of the day explore."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: and, seizing Thrasymedes' shield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(His valiant offspring,) hasten'd to the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(That day the son his father's buckler bore;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then snatch'd a lance, and issued from the door.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as the prospect open'd to his view,</l>
<pb n="254" /><anchor id="Pg254" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dire disarray! the tumult of the fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wall in ruins, and the Greeks in flight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when old ocean's silent surface sleeps,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The waves just heaving on the purple deeps:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While yet the expected tempest hangs on high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Weighs down the cloud, and blackens in the sky,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mass of waters will no wind obey;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove sends one gust, and bids them roll away.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While wavering counsels thus his mind engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fluctuates in doubtful thought the Pylian sage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To join the host, or to the general haste;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Debating long, he fixes on the last:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet, as he moves, the sight his bosom warms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The field rings dreadful with the clang of arms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gleaming falchions flash, the javelins fly;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Blows echo blows, and all or kill or die.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him, in his march, the wounded princes meet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By tardy steps ascending from the fleet:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king of men, Ulysses the divine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And who to Tydeus owes his noble line.<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Who to Tydeus owes, i.e.</hi> Diomed.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Their ships at distance from the battle stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In lines advanced along the shelving strand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose bay, the fleet unable to contain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At length; beside the margin of the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rank above rank, the crowded ships they moor:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who landed first, lay highest on the shore.)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Supported on the spears, they took their way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unfit to fight, but anxious for the day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nestor's approach alarm'd each Grecian breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom thus the general of the host address'd:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O grace and glory of the Achaian name;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What drives thee, Nestor, from the field of fame?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall then proud Hector see his boast fulfill'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our fleets in ashes, and our heroes kill'd?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such was his threat, ah! now too soon made good,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On many a Grecian bosom writ in blood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is every heart inflamed with equal rage</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against your king, nor will one chief engage?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And have I lived to see with mournful eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In every Greek a new Achilles rise?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gerenian Nestor then: "So fate has will'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all-confirming time has fate fulfill'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not he that thunders from the aerial bower,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not Jove himself, upon the past has power.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wall, our late inviolable bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And best defence, lies smoking on the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even to the ships their conquering arms extend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And groans of slaughter'd Greeks to heaven ascend.</l>
<pb n="255" /><anchor id="Pg255" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On speedy measures then employ your thought</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In such distress! if counsel profit aught:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arms cannot much: though Mars our souls incite,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These gaping wounds withhold us from the fight."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him the monarch: "That our army bends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That Troy triumphant our high fleet ascends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And that the rampart, late our surest trust</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And best defence, lies smoking in the dust;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All this from Jove's afflictive hand we bear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who, far from Argos, wills our ruin here.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Past are the days when happier Greece was blest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all his favour, all his aid confess'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now heaven averse, our hands from battle ties,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lifts the Trojan glory to the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Cease we at length to waste our blood in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And launch what ships lie nearest to the main;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Leave these at anchor, till the coming night:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, if impetuous Troy forbear the fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bring all to sea, and hoist each sail for flight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Better from evils, well foreseen, to run,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Than perish in the danger we may shun."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus he. The sage Ulysses thus replies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What shameful words (unkingly as thou art)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thou the shame of any host but ours!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A host, by Jove endued with martial might,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And taught to conquer, or to fall in fight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Adventurous combats and bold wars to wage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Employ'd our youth, and yet employs our age.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wilt thou thus desert the Trojan plain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In such base sentence if thou couch thy fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Speak it in whispers, lest a Greek should hear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lives there a man so dead to fame, who dares</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To think such meanness, or the thought declares?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And comes it even from him whose sovereign sway</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The banded legions of all Greece obey?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is this a general's voice that calls to flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While war hangs doubtful, while his soldiers fight?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What more could Troy? What yet their fate denies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou givest the foe: all Greece becomes their prize.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more the troops (our hoisted sails in view,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Themselves abandon'd) shall the fight pursue;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But thy ships flying, with despair shall see;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And owe destruction to a prince like thee."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thy just reproofs (Atrides calm replies)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like arrows pierce me, for thy words are wise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unwilling as I am to lose the host,</l>
<pb n="256" /><anchor id="Pg256" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I force not Greece to quit this hateful coast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Glad I submit, whoe'er, or young, or old,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Aught, more conducive to our weal, unfold."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tydides cut him short, and thus began:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Such counsel if you seek, behold the man</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who boldly gives it, and what he shall say,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Young though he be, disdain not to obey:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A youth, who from the mighty Tydeus springs,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">May speak to councils and assembled kings.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hear then in me the great OEnides' son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose honoured dust (his race of glory run)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies whelm'd in ruins of the Theban wall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Brave in his life, and glorious in his fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With three bold sons was generous Prothous bless'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who Pleuron's walls and Calydon possess'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Melas and Agrius, but (who far surpass'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rest in courage) OEneus was the last.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From him, my sire. From Calydon expell'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He pass'd to Argos, and in exile dwell'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The monarch's daughter there (so Jove ordain'd)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He won, and flourish'd where Adrastus reign'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There, rich in fortune's gifts, his acres till'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beheld his vines their liquid harvest yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And numerous flocks that whiten'd all the field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such Tydeus was, the foremost once in fame!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor lives in Greece a stranger to his name.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, what for common good my thoughts inspire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Attend, and in the son respect the sire.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though sore of battle, though with wounds oppress'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let each go forth, and animate the rest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Advance the glory which he cannot share,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though not partaker, witness of the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But lest new wounds on wounds o'erpower us quite,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beyond the missile javelin's sounding flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe let us stand; and, from the tumult far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Inspire the ranks, and rule the distant war."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He added not: the listening kings obey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Slow moving on; Atrides leads the way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god of ocean (to inflame their rage)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Appears a warrior furrowed o'er with age;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Press'd in his own, the general's hand he took,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus the venerable hero spoke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Atrides! lo! with what disdainful eye</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles sees his country's forces fly;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Blind, impious man! whose anger is his guide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who glories in unutterable pride.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So may he perish, so may Jove disclaim</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wretch relentless, and o'erwhelm with shame!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Heaven forsakes not thee: o'er yonder sands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon shall thou view the scattered Trojan bands</l>
<pb n="257" /><anchor id="Pg257" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fly diverse; while proud kings, and chiefs renown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Driven heaps on heaps, with clouds involved around</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of rolling dust, their winged wheels employ</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To hide their ignominious heads in Troy."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, then rush'd amid the warrior crew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sent his voice before him as he flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud, as the shout encountering armies yield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When twice ten thousand shake the labouring field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such was the voice, and such the thundering sound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of him whose trident rends the solid ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each Argive bosom beats to meet the fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And grisly war appears a pleasing sight.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime Saturnia from Olympus' brow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High-throned in gold, beheld the fields below;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With joy the glorious conflict she survey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where her great brother gave the Grecians aid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But placed aloft, on Ida's shady height</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She sees her Jove, and trembles at the sight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove to deceive, what methods shall she try,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What arts, to blind his all-beholding eye?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At length she trusts her power; resolved to prove</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The old, yet still successful, cheat of love;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against his wisdom to oppose her charms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lull the lord of thunders in her arms.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift to her bright apartment she repairs,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sacred to dress and beauty's pleasing cares:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With skill divine had Vulcan form'd the bower,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe from access of each intruding power.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Touch'd with her secret key, the doors unfold:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Self-closed, behind her shut the valves of gold.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here first she bathes; and round her body pours</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soft oils of fragrance, and ambrosial showers:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The winds, perfumed, the balmy gale convey</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through heaven, through earth, and all the aerial way:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spirit divine! whose exhalation greets</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sense of gods with more than mortal sweets.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus while she breathed of heaven, with decent pride</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her artful hands the radiant tresses tied;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Part on her head in shining ringlets roll'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Part o'er her shoulders waved like melted gold.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around her next a heavenly mantle flow'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That rich with Pallas' labour'd colours glow'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Large clasps of gold the foldings gather'd round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A golden zone her swelling bosom bound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far-beaming pendants tremble in her ear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each gem illumined with a triple star.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then o'er her head she cast a veil more white</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Than new-fallen snow, and dazzling as the light.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Last her fair feet celestial sandals grace.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus issuing radiant with majestic pace,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"How long (to Venus thus apart she cried)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall human strife celestial minds divide?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah yet, will Venus aid Saturnia's joy,</l>

by later writers, he is likewise the adopted son of Asterius, as

of Dorus, who is related either to have crossed over from Thessaly, or

<l rend="margin-left: 2">His mournful followers, with assistant care,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When now they touch'd the mead's enamell'd side,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where gentle Xanthus rolls his easy tide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With watery drops the chief they sprinkle round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Placed on the margin of the flowery ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Raised on his knees, he now ejects the gore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now faints anew, low-sinking on the shore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By fits he breathes, half views the fleeting skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And seals again, by fits, his swimming eyes.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as the Greeks the chief's retreat beheld,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With double fury each invades the field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oilean Ajax first his javelin sped,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced by whose point the son of Enops bled;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">An arduous battle rose around the dead;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By turns the Greeks, by turns the Trojans bled.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fired with revenge, Polydamas drew near,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">As by his side the groaning warrior fell,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At the fierce foe he launch'd his piercing steel;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The foe, reclining, shunn'd the flying death;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But fate, Archilochus, demands thy breath:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy lofty birth no succour could impart,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift to perform heaven's fatal will, it fled</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the juncture of the neck and head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And took the joint, and cut the nerves in twain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dropping head first tumbled on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So just the stroke, that yet the body stood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Erect, then roll'd along the sands in blood.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Here, proud Polydamas, here turn thy eyes!</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antenor's brother, or perhaps his son."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spake, and smiled severe, for well he knew</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bleeding youth: Troy sadden'd at the view.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But furious Acamas avenged his cause;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As Promachus his slaughtered brother draws,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He pierced his heart—"Such fate attends you all,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proud Argives! destined by our arms to fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not Troy alone, but haughty Greece, shall share</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The toils, the sorrows, and the wounds of war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold your Promachus deprived of breath,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not unappeased he enters Pluto's gate,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heart-piercing anguish struck the Grecian host,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But touch'd the breast of bold Peneleus most;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At the proud boaster he directs his course;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift his broad falchion fierce Peneleus spread,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lance, yet sticking through the bleeding eye,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The victor seized; and, as aloft he shook</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Trojans! your great Ilioneus behold!</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE FIFTH BATTLE AT THE SHIPS; AND THE ACTS OF AJAX.</p>

<p>Jupiter, awaking, sees the Trojans repulsed from the trenches, Hector
in a swoon, and Neptune at the head of the Greeks: he is highly
incensed at the artifice of Juno, who appeases him by her submissions;
she is then sent to Iris and Apollo. Juno, repairing to the assembly of
the gods, attempts, with extraordinary address, to incense them against
Jupiter; in particular she touches Mars with a violent resentment; he
is ready to take arms, but is prevented by Minerva. Iris and Apollo
obey the orders of Jupiter; Iris commands Neptune to leave the battle,
to which, after much reluctance and passion, he consents. Apollo
reinspires Hector with vigour, brings him back to the battle, marches
before him with his aegis, and turns the fortune of the fight. He
breaks down great part of the Grecian wall: the Trojans rush in, and
attempt to fire the first line of the fleet, but are, as yet, repelled
by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now in swift flight they pass the trench profound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And many a chief lay gasping on the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then stopp'd and panted, where the chariots lie</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fear on their cheek, and horror in their eye.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile, awaken'd from his dream of love,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On Ida's summit sat imperial Jove:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Round the wide fields he cast a careful view,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There saw the Trojans fly, the Greeks pursue;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These proud in arms, those scatter'd o'er the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, 'midst the war, the monarch of the main.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not far, great Hector on the dust he spies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(His sad associates round with weeping eyes,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ejecting blood, and panting yet for breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His senses wandering to the verge of death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god beheld him with a pitying look,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus, incensed, to fraudful Juno spoke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O thou, still adverse to the eternal will,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For ever studious in promoting ill!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy arts have made the godlike Hector yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And driven his conquering squadrons from the field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Canst thou, unhappy in thy wiles, withstand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our power immense, and brave the almighty hand?</l>
<pb n="269" /><anchor id="Pg269" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hast thou forgot, when, bound and fix'd on high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the vast concave of the spangled sky,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I hung thee trembling in a golden chain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all the raging gods opposed in vain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Headlong I hurl'd them from the Olympian hall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stunn'd in the whirl, and breathless with the fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For godlike Hercules these deeds were done,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor seem'd the vengeance worthy such a son:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When, by thy wiles induced, fierce Boreas toss'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shipwreck'd hero on the Coan coast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him through a thousand forms of death I bore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sent to Argos, and his native shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hear this, remember, and our fury dread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lest arts and blandishments successless prove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy soft deceits, and well-dissembled love."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Thunderer spoke: imperial Juno mourn'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, trembling, these submissive words return'd:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"By every oath that powers immortal ties,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The foodful earth and all-infolding skies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By thy black waves, tremendous Styx! that flow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the drear realms of gliding ghosts below;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By the dread honours of thy sacred head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And that unbroken vow, our virgin bed!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not by my arts the ruler of the main</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Steeps Troy in blood, and ranges round the plain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By his own ardour, his own pity sway'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To help his Greeks, he fought and disobey'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Else had thy Juno better counsels given,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And taught submission to the sire of heaven."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Think'st thou with me? fair empress of the skies!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The immortal father with a smile replies;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then soon the haughty sea-god shall obey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor dare to act but when we point the way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If truth inspires thy tongue, proclaim our will</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To yon bright synod on the Olympian hill;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our high decree let various Iris know,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And call the god that bears the silver bow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let her descend, and from the embattled plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Command the sea-god to his watery reign:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Phoebus hastes great Hector to prepare</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To rise afresh, and once more wake the war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His labouring bosom re-inspires with breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And calls his senses from the verge of death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece chased by Troy, even to Achilles' fleet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall fall by thousands at the hero's feet.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He, not untouch'd with pity, to the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall send Patroclus, but shall send in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What youths he slaughters under Ilion's walls!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even my loved son, divine Sarpedon, falls!</l>
<pb n="270" /><anchor id="Pg270" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vanquish'd at last by Hector's lance he lies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, nor till then, shall great Achilles rise:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lo! that instant, godlike Hector dies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From that great hour the war's whole fortune turns,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pallas assists, and lofty Ilion burns.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not till that day shall Jove relax his rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor one of all the heavenly host engage</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In aid of Greece. The promise of a god</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I gave, and seal'd it with the almighty nod,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles' glory to the stars to raise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such was our word, and fate the word obeys."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The trembling queen (the almighty order given)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift from the Idaean summit shot to heaven.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As some wayfaring man, who wanders o'er</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In thought a length of lands he trod before,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sends forth his active mind from place to place,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Joins hill to dale, and measures space with space:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So swift flew Juno to the bless'd abodes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If thought of man can match the speed of gods.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There sat the powers in awful synod placed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They bow'd, and made obeisance as she pass'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through all the brazen dome: with goblets crown'd<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">The brazen dome.</hi> See the note on Bk. viii. Page 142.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They hail her queen; the nectar streams around.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fair Themis first presents the golden bowl,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And anxious asks what cares disturb her soul?</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the white-arm'd goddess thus replies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Enough thou know'st the tyrant of the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Severely bent his purpose to fulfil,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unmoved his mind, and unrestrain'd his will.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go thou, the feasts of heaven attend thy call;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bid the crown'd nectar circle round the hall:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such stern decrees, such threaten'd woes to come,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And damp the eternal banquets of the skies."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The goddess said, and sullen took her place;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Black horror sadden'd each celestial face.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To see the gathering grudge in every breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Smiles on her lips a spleenful joy express'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While on her wrinkled front, and eyebrow bent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sat stedfast care, and lowering discontent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus she proceeds—"Attend, ye powers above!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But know, 'tis madness to contest with Jove:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Supreme he sits; and sees, in pride of sway.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your vassal godheads grudgingly obey:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce in the majesty of power controls;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shakes all the thrones of heaven, and bends the poles.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Submiss, immortals! all he wills, obey:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thou, great Mars, begin and show the way.</l>
<pb n="271" /><anchor id="Pg271" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold Ascalaphus! behold him die,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But dare not murmur, dare not vent a sigh;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy own loved boasted offspring lies o'erthrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If that loved boasted offspring be thy own."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern Mars, with anguish for his slaughter'd son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Smote his rebelling breast, and fierce begun:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thus then, immortals! thus shall Mars obey;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forgive me, gods, and yield my vengeance way:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Descending first to yon forbidden plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god of battles dares avenge the slain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dares, though the thunder bursting o'er my head</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With that he gives command to Fear and Flight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To join his rapid coursers for the fight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then grim in arms, with hasty vengeance flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arms that reflect a radiance through the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now had Jove, by bold rebellion driven,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Pallas, springing through the bright abode,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Starts from her azure throne to calm the god.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck for the immortal race with timely fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From frantic Mars she snatch'd the shield and spear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then the huge helmet lifting from his head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to the impetuous homicide she said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"By what wild passion, furious! art thou toss'd?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Striv'st thou with Jove? thou art already lost.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall not the Thunderer's dread command restrain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And was imperial Juno heard in vain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in thy guilt involve the host of heaven?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ilion and Greece no more should Jove engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The skies would yield an ampler scene of rage;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Guilty and guiltless find an equal fate</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And one vast ruin whelm the Olympian state.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Cease then thy offspring's death unjust to call;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heroes as great have died, and yet shall fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Why should heaven's law with foolish man comply</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Exempted from the race ordain'd to die?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This menace fix'd the warrior to his throne;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sullen he sat, and curb'd the rising groan.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Juno call'd (Jove's orders to obey)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The winged Iris, and the god of day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Go wait the Thunderer's will (Saturnia cried)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On yon tall summit of the fountful Ide:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around the globe, whose earthquakes rock the world,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Desists at length his rebel-war to wage,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Well was the crime, and well the vengeance spared;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fly to their ships and Hellespont again:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Greece shall breathe from toils." The godhead said;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His will divine the son of Jove obey'd.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">That drives a turtle through the liquid skies,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Why sits great Hector from the field so far?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What grief, what wound, withholds thee from the war?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fainting hero, as the vision bright</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stood shining o'er him, half unseal'd his sight:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What blest immortal, with commanding breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus wakens Hector from the sleep of death?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Has fame not told, how, while my trusty sword</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bathed Greece in slaughter, and her battle gored,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mighty Ajax with a deadly blow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had almost sunk me to the shades below?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even yet, methinks, the gliding ghosts I spy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hell's black horrors swim before my eye."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him Apollo: "Be no more dismay'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">See, and be strong! the Thunderer sends thee aid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold! thy Phoebus shall his arms employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Phoebus, propitious still to thee and Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Inspire thy warriors then with manly force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And to the ships impel thy rapid horse:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even I will make thy fiery coursers way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And drive the Grecians headlong to the sea."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to bold Hector spoke the son of Jove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And breathed immortal ardour from above.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when the pamper'd steed, with reins unbound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Breaks from his stall, and pours along the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With ample strokes he rushes to the flood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To bathe his sides, and cool his fiery blood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His head, now freed, he tosses to the skies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He snuffs the females in the well-known plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And springs, exulting, to his fields again:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Urged by the voice divine, thus Hector flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full of the god; and all his hosts pursue.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when the force of men and dogs combined</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Invade the mountain goat, or branching hind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far from the hunter's rage secure they lie</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close in the rock, (not fated yet to die)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When lo! a lion shoots across the way!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They fly: at once the chasers and the prey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Greece, that late in conquering troops pursued,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And mark'd their progress through the ranks in blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as they see the furious chief appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forget to vanquish, and consent to fear.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thoas with grief observed his dreadful course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thoas, the bravest of the Ætolian force;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Skill'd to direct the javelin's distant flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bold to combat in the standing fight,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not more in councils famed for solid sense,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Than winning words and heavenly eloquence.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Gods! what portent (he cried) these eyes invades?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! Hector rises from the Stygian shades!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">We saw him, late, by thundering Ajax kill'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What god restores him to the frighted field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And not content that half of Greece lie slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pours new destruction on her sons again?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He comes not, Jove! without thy powerful will;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! still he lives, pursues, and conquers still!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet hear my counsel, and his worst withstand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks' main body to the fleet command;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But let the few whom brisker spirits warm,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stand the first onset, and provoke the storm.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus point your arms; and when such foes appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce as he is, let Hector learn to fear."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior spoke; the listening Greeks obey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thickening their ranks, and form a deep array.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each Ajax, Teucer, Merion gave command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The valiant leader of the Cretan band;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Mars-like Meges: these the chiefs excite,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Approach the foe, and meet the coming fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behind, unnumber'd multitudes attend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To flank the navy, and the shores defend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the front the pressing Trojans bear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Hector first came towering to the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Phoebus himself the rushing battle led;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A veil of clouds involved his radiant head:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High held before him, Jove's enormous shield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Portentous shone, and shaded all the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vulcan to Jove the immortal gift consign'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To scatter hosts and terrify mankind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From different parts, and mingle in the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And arrows leaping from the bow-string sung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These drink the life of generous warriors slain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As long as Phoebus bore unmoved the shield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sat doubtful conquest hovering o'er the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when aloft he shakes it in the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep horror seizes every Grecian breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their force is humbled, and their fear confess'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So flies a herd of oxen, scatter'd wide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No swain to guard them, and no day to guide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When two fell lions from the mountain come,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And spread the carnage through the shady gloom.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Impending Phoebus pours around them fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Troy and Hector thunder in the rear.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">A banish'd man, in Phylace he dwell'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Press'd by the vengeance of an angry wife;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy ends at last his labours and his life.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">A mournful witness of this scene of woe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I haste to urge him by his country's care</l>
<pb n="278" /><anchor id="Pg278" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To rise in arms, and shine again in war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The voice is powerful of a faithful friend."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke; and, speaking, swifter than the wind</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from the tent, and left the war behind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The embodied Greeks the fierce attack sustain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But strive, though numerous, to repulse in vain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor could the Trojans, through that firm array,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Force to the fleet and tents the impervious way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when a shipwright, with Palladian art,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Smooths the rough wood, and levels every part;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With equal hand he guides his whole design,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By the just rule, and the directing line:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The martial leaders, with like skill and care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Preserved their line, and equal kept the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Brave deeds of arms through all the ranks were tried,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And every ship sustained an equal tide.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At one proud bark, high-towering o'er the fleet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ajax the great, and godlike Hector meet;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For one bright prize the matchless chiefs contend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor this the ships can fire, nor that defend:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One kept the shore, and one the vessel trod;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That fix'd as fate, this acted by a god.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Clytius in his daring hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The deck approaching, shakes a flaming brand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But, pierced by Telamon's huge lance, expires:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thundering he falls, and drops the extinguish'd fires.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Hector view'd him with a sad survey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As stretch'd in dust before the stern he lay.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Oh! all of Trojan, all of Lycian race!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stand to your arms, maintain this arduous space:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! where the son of royal Clytius lies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah, save his arms, secure his obsequies!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, his eager javelin sought the foe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Ajax shunn'd the meditated blow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It stretch'd in dust unhappy Lycophron:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">An exile long, sustain'd at Ajax' board,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A faithful servant to a foreign lord;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In peace, and war, for ever at his side,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Near his loved master, as he lived, he died.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the high poop he tumbles on the sand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lies a lifeless load along the land.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With anguish Ajax views the piercing sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus inflames his brother to the fight:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Teucer, behold! extended on the shore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our friend, our loved companion! now no more!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dear as a parent, with a parent's care</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To fight our wars he left his native air.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This death deplored, to Hector's rage we owe;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Revenge, revenge it on the cruel foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where are those darts on which the fates attend?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And where the bow which Phoebus taught to bend?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Impatient Teucer, hastening to his aid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before the chief his ample bow display'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The well-stored quiver on his shoulders hung:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then hiss'd his arrow, and the bowstring sung.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Clytus, Pisenor's son, renown'd in fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(To thee, Polydamas! an honour'd name)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drove through the thickest of the embattled plains</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The startling steeds, and shook his eager reins.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As all on glory ran his ardent mind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The pointed death arrests him from behind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through his fair neck the thrilling arrow flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In youth's first bloom reluctantly he dies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hurl'd from the lofty seat, at distance far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The headlong coursers spurn his empty car;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till sad Polydamas the steeds restrain'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gave, Astynous, to thy careful hand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, fired to vengeance, rush'd amidst the foe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rage edged his sword, and strengthen'd every blow.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Once more bold Teucer, in his country's cause,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At Hector's breast a chosen arrow draws:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And had the weapon found the destined way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy fall, great Trojan! had renown'd that day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Hector was not doom'd to perish then:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The all-wise disposer of the fates of men</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Imperial Jove) his present death withstands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor was such glory due to Teucer's hands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At its full stretch as the tough string he drew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck by an arm unseen, it burst in two;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Down dropp'd the bow: the shaft with brazen head</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fell innocent, and on the dust lay dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The astonish'd archer to great Ajax cries;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Some god prevents our destined enterprise:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some god, propitious to the Trojan foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Has, from my arm unfailing, struck the bow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And broke the nerve my hands had twined with art,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Strong to impel the flight of many a dart."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Since heaven commands it (Ajax made reply)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dismiss the bow, and lay thy arrows by:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And quit the quiver for the ponderous shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy brave example shall the rest inflame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce as they are, by long successes vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To force our fleet, or even a ship to gain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Asks toil, and sweat, and blood: their utmost might</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall find its match—No more: 'tis ours to fight."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Teucer laid his faithless bow aside;</l>
<pb n="280" /><anchor id="Pg280" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fourfold buckler o'er his shoulder tied;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On his brave head a crested helm he placed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With nodding horse-hair formidably graced;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A dart, whose point with brass refulgent shines,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior wields; and his great brother joins.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This Hector saw, and thus express'd his joy:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye troops of Lycia, Dardanus, and Troy!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be mindful of yourselves, your ancient fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And spread your glory with the navy's flame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove is with us; I saw his hand, but now,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the proud archer strike his vaunted bow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Indulgent Jove! how plain thy favours shine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When happy nations bear the marks divine!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How easy then, to see the sinking state</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of realms accursed, deserted, reprobate!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such is the fate of Greece, and such is ours:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold, ye warriors, and exert your powers.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Death is the worst; a fate which all must try;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And for our country, 'tis a bliss to die.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gallant man, though slain in fight he be,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet leaves his nation safe, his children free;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Entails a debt on all the grateful state;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His own brave friends shall glory in his fate;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His wife live honour'd, all his race succeed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And late posterity enjoy the deed!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This roused the soul in every Trojan breast:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The godlike Ajax next his Greeks address'd:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"How long, ye warriors of the Argive race,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(To generous Argos what a dire disgrace!)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How long on these cursed confines will ye lie,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet undetermined, or to live or die?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What hopes remain, what methods to retire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If once your vessels catch the Trojan fire?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Make how the flames approach, how near they fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How Hector calls, and Troy obeys his call!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not to the dance that dreadful voice invites,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It calls to death, and all the rage of fights.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis now no time for wisdom or debates;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To your own hands are trusted all your fates;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And better far in one decisive strife,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One day should end our labour or our life,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Than keep this hard-got inch of barren sands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still press'd, and press'd by such inglorious hands."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The listening Grecians feel their leader's flame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And every kindling bosom pants for fame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then mutual slaughters spread on either side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Hector here the Phocian Schedius died;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There, pierced by Ajax, sunk Laodamas,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Chief of the foot, of old Antenor's race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Polydamas laid Otus on the sand,</l>
<pb n="281" /><anchor id="Pg281" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fierce commander of the Epeian band.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His lance bold Meges at the victor threw;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The victor, stooping, from the death withdrew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(That valued life, O Phoebus! was thy care)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Croesmus' bosom took the flying spear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His radiant arms triumphant Meges bore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dolops, the son of Lampus, rushes on,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from the race of old Laomedon,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And famed for prowess in a well-fought field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He pierced the centre of his sounding shield:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Meges, Phyleus' ample breastplate wore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Well-known in fight on Selle's winding shore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For king Euphetes gave the golden mail,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Compact, and firm with many a jointed scale)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which oft, in cities storm'd, and battles won,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had saved the father, and now saves the son.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full at the Trojan's head he urged his lance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where the high plumes above the helmet dance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">New ting'd with Tyrian dye: in dust below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shorn from the crest, the purple honours glow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime their fight the Spartan king survey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stood by Meges' side a sudden aid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through Dolops' shoulder urged his forceful dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which held its passage through the panting heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And issued at his breast. With thundering sound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior falls, extended on the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In rush the conquering Greeks to spoil the slain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Hector's voice excites his kindred train;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero most, from Hicetaon sprung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce Melanippus, gallant, brave, and young.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He (ere to Troy the Grecians cross'd the main)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fed his large oxen on Percote's plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when oppress'd, his country claim'd his care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Return'd to Ilion, and excell'd in war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For this, in Priam's court, he held his place,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beloved no less than Priam's royal race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him Hector singled, as his troops he led,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus inflamed him, pointing to the dead.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Lo, Melanippus! lo, where Dolops lies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And is it thus our royal kinsman dies?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'ermatch'd he falls; to two at once a prey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lo! they bear the bloody arms away!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Come on—a distant war no longer wage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But hand to hand thy country's foes engage:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till Greece at once, and all her glory end;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or Ilion from her towery height descend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaved from the lowest stone; and bury all</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In one sad sepulchre, one common fall."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector (this said) rush'd forward on the foes:</l>
<pb n="282" /><anchor id="Pg282" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With equal ardour Melanippus glows:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ajax thus—"O Greeks! respect your fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Respect yourselves, and learn an honest shame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And catch from breast to breast the noble fire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On valour's side the odds of combat lie;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brave live glorious, or lamented die;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wretch that trembles in the field of fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His generous sense he not in vain imparts;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It sunk, and rooted in the Grecian hearts:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They join, they throng, they thicken at his call,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And flank the navy with a brazen wall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shields touching shields, in order blaze above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stop the Trojans, though impell'd by Jove.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fiery Spartan first, with loud applause.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Warms the bold son of Nestor in his cause.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Is there (he said) in arms a youth like you,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So strong to fight, so active to pursue?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lift the bold lance, and make some Trojan bleed."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said; and backward to the lines retired;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth rush'd the youth with martial fury fired,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beyond the foremost ranks; his lance he threw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And round the black battalions cast his view.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The troops of Troy recede with sudden fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the swift javelin hiss'd along in air.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Advancing Melanippus met the dart</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With his bold breast, and felt it in his heart:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thundering he falls; his falling arms resound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his broad buckler rings against the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The victor leaps upon his prostrate prize:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus on a roe the well-breath'd beagle flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rends his side, fresh-bleeding with the dart</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The distant hunter sent into his heart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Observing Hector to the rescue flew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bold as he was, Antilochus withdrew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So when a savage, ranging o'er the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Has torn the shepherd's dog, or shepherd's swain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While conscious of the deed, he glares around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hears the gathering multitude resound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Timely he flies the yet-untasted food,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gains the friendly shelter of the wood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So fears the youth; all Troy with shouts pursue,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While stones and darts in mingled tempest flew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But enter'd in the Grecian ranks, he turns</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His manly breast, and with new fury burns.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of Jove:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sire of gods, confirming Thetis' prayer,</l>
<pb n="283" /><anchor id="Pg283" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Grecian ardour quench'd in deep despair;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But lifts to glory Troy's prevailing bands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On Ida's top he waits with longing eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To view the navy blazing to the skies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojans fly, and conquer'd Ilion burn.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These fates revolved in his almighty mind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He raises Hector to the work design'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bids him with more than mortal fury glow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not with more rage a conflagration rolls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The radiant helmet on his temple burns,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Waves when he nods, and lightens as he turns:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For Jove his splendour round the chief had thrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unhappy glories! for his fate was near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Due to stern Pallas, and Pelides' spear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet Jove deferr'd the death he was to pay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gave what fate allow'd, the honours of a day!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Burn at each foe, and single every prize;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He points his ardour, and exerts his might.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On all sides batter'd, yet resists his power:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So some tall rock o'erhangs the hoary main,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">So some tall rock.</hi></p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"But like a rock unmov'd, a rock that braves</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The raging tempest, and the rising waves—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Propp'd on himself he stands: his solid sides</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wash off the sea-weeds, and the sounding tides."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sees the watery mountains break below.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Girt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, swell'd with tempests, on the ship descends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">White are the decks with foam; the winds aloud</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Howl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And instant death on every wave appears.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when a lion, rushing from his den,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amidst the plain of some wide-water'd fen,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At large expatiate o'er the ranker mead)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Leaps on the herds before the herdsman's eyes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The trembling herdsman far to distance flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some lordly bull (the rest dispersed and fled)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He singles out; arrests, and lays him dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All Greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mycenian Periphes, a mighty name,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The minister of stern Eurystheus' ire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against Alcides, Copreus was his sire:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son redeem'd the honours of the race,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A son as generous as the sire was base;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er all his country's youth conspicuous far</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In every virtue, or of peace or war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But doom'd to Hector's stronger force to yield!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against the margin of his ample shield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He struck his hasty foot: his heels up-sprung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Supine he fell; his brazen helmet rung.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On the fallen chief the invading Trojan press'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And plunged the pointed javelin in his breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His circling friends, who strove to guard too late</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The unhappy hero, fled, or shared his fate.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wedged in one body at the tents they stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wall'd round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full twenty cubits long, he swings around;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor fights, like others, fix'd to certain stands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But looks a moving tower above the bands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on the decks with vast gigantic stride,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The godlike hero stalks from side to side.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So when a horseman from the watery mead</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Skill'd in the manage of the bounding steed)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drives four fair coursers, practised to obey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To some great city through the public way;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lay rank'd contiguous on the bending shores;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So the strong eagle from his airy height,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who marks the swans' or cranes' embodied flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stoops down impetuous, while they light for food,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou wouldst have thought, so furious was their fire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No force could tame them, and no toil could tire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As if new vigour from new fights they won,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the long battle was but then begun.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece, yet unconquer'd, kept alive the war,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bright with the blaze, and red with heroes slain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like strength is felt from hope, and from despair,</l>

<p>ARGUMENT</p>

<p>THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS</p>

<p>Patroclus (in pursuance of the request of Nestor in the eleventh book)
entreats Achilles to suffer him to go to the assistance of the Greeks
with Achilles' troops and armour. He agrees to it, but at the same time
charges him to content himself with rescuing the fleet, without further
pursuit of the enemy. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers are
described. Achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend,
after which Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The Trojans, at
the sight of Patroclus in Achilles' armour, taking him for that hero,
are cast into the uttermost consternation; he beats them off from
the vessels, Hector himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter
was averse to his fate. Several other particulars of the battle are
described; in the heat of which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of
Achilles, pursues the foe to the walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses
and disarms him, Euphorbus wounds him, and Hector kills him, which
concludes the book.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So warr'd both armies on the ensanguined shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the black vessels smoked with human gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime Patroclus to Achilles flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The streaming tears fall copious from his eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not faster, trickling to the plains below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the tall rock the sable waters flow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Divine Pelides, with compassion moved.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spoke, indulgent, to his best beloved:<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">His best beloved.</hi> The following elegant remarks of
Thirlwall (Greece, vol. i, p. 176 seq.) well illustrate the character
of the friendship subsisting between these two heroes—</p>

<p>"One of the noblest and most amiable sides of the Greek character, is
the readiness with which it lent itself to construct intimate and
durable friendships, and this is a feature no less prominent in the
earliest than in later times. It was indeed connected with the
comparatively low estimation in which female society was held; but the
devotedness and constancy with which these attachments were maintained,
was not the less admirable and engaging. The heroic companions whom we
find celebrated partly by Homer and partly in traditions which, if not
of equal antiquity, were grounded on the same feeling, seem to have but
one heart and soul, with scarcely a wish or object apart, and only to
live as they are always ready to die for one another. It is true that
the relation between them is not always one of perfect equality; but
this is a circumstance which, while it often adds a peculiar charm
to the poetical description, detracts little from the dignity of the
idea which it presents. Such were the friendships of Hercules and
Iolaus, of Theseus and Pirithous, of Orestes and Pylades; and though
These may owe the greater part of their fame to the later epic or even
dramatic poetry, the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the
period to which the traditions are referred. The argument of the Iliad
mainly turns on the affection of Achilles for Patroclus, whose love for
the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for his higher birth and
his unequalled prowess. But the mutual regard which united Idomeneus
and Meriones, Diomedes and Sthenelus, though, as the persons themselves
are less important, it is kept more in the back-ground, is manifestly
viewed by the poet in the same light. The idea of a Greek hero seems
not to have been thought complete, without such a brother in arms by
his side."—Thirlwall, Greece, vol. i. p. 176, seq.</p></note></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Griev'st thou for me, or for, my martial band?</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And speak those sorrows which a friend would share."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sigh that instant from his bosom broke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Another follow'd, and Patroclus spoke:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Let Greece at length with pity touch thy breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thyself a Greek; and, once, of Greeks the best!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! every chief that might her fate prevent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies pierced with wounds, and bleeding in his tent:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eurypylus, Tydides, Atreus' son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wise Ulysses, at the navy groan,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">More for their country's wounds than for their own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their pain soft arts of pharmacy can ease,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy breast alone no lenitives appease.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">May never rage like thine my soul enslave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O great in vain! unprofitably brave!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy country slighted in her last distress,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What friend, what man, from thee shall hope redress?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No—men unborn, and ages yet behind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall curse that fierce, that unforgiving mind.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O man unpitying! if of man thy race;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But sure thou spring'st not from a soft embrace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor ever amorous hero caused thy birth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor ever tender goddess brought thee forth:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some rugged rock's hard entrails gave thee form,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And raging seas produced thee in a storm,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A soul well suiting that tempestuous kind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So rough thy manners, so untamed thy mind.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"If some dire oracle thy breast alarm,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If aught from Jove, or Thetis, stop thy arm,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But touch not Hector, Hector is my due.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though Jove in thunder should command the war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be just, consult my glory, and forbear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fleet once saved, desist from further chase,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor lead to Ilion's walls the Grecian race;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some adverse god thy rashness may destroy;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some god, like Phoebus, ever kind to Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let Greece, redeem'd from this destructive strait,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Do her own work; and leave the rest to fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O! would to all the immortal powers above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Apollo, Pallas, and almighty Jove!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That not one Trojan might be left alive,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And not a Greek of all the race survive:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Might only we the vast destruction shun,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And only we destroy the accursed town!"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such conference held the chiefs; while on the strand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Jove with conquest crown'd the Trojan band.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ajax no more the sounding storm sustain'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So thick the darts an iron tempest rain'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On his tired arm the weighty buckler hung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His hollow helm with falling javelins rung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His breath, in quick short pantings, comes and goes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And painful sweat from all his members flows.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spent and o'erpower'd, he barely breathes at most;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet scarce an army stirs him from his post;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dangers on dangers all around him glow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And toil to toil, and woe succeeds to woe.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Say, Muses, throned above the starry frame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How first the navy blazed with Trojan flame?</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern Hector waved his sword, and standing near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where furious Ajax plied his ashen spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the lance a stroke so justly sped,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That the broad falchion lopp'd its brazen head;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brazen head falls sounding on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Ajax saw, and own'd the hand divine;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confessing Jove, and trembling at the sign,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Warn'd he retreats. Then swift from all sides pour</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hissing brands; thick streams the fiery shower;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er the high stern the curling volumes rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sheets of rolling smoke involve the skies.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Divine Achilles view'd the rising flames,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And smote his thigh, and thus aloud exclaims:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Arm, arm, Patroclus! Lo, the blaze aspires!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The glowing ocean reddens with the fires.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The clasping greaves; then to his breast applies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flaming cuirass of a thousand dyes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Emblazed with studs of gold his falchion shone</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In the rich belt, as in a starry zone:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles' shield his ample shoulders spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles' helmet nodded o'er his head:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Adorn'd in all his terrible array,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He flash'd around intolerable day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alone untouch'd, Pelides' javelin stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not to be poised but by Pelides' hands:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Pelion's shady brow the plant entire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Old Chiron rent, and shaped it for his sire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose son's great arm alone the weapon wields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus while he roused the fire in every breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close and more close the listening cohorts press'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ranks wedged in ranks; of arms a steely ring</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still grows, and spreads, and thickens round the king.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when a circling wall the builder forms,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The presents of the silver-footed dame)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From thence he took a bowl, of antique frame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which never man had stained with ruddy wine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor raised in offerings to the power divine,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Peleus' son; and Peleus' son to none</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had raised in offerings, but to Jove alone.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This tinged with sulphur, sacred first to flame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He purged; and wash'd it in the running stream.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then cleansed his hands; and fixing for a space</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His eyes on heaven, his feet upon the place</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of sacrifice, the purple draught he pour'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth in the midst; and thus the god implored:</l>
</lg>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O thou supreme! high-throned all height above!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O great Pelasgic, Dodonaean Jove!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who 'midst surrounding frosts, and vapours chill,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Presid'st on bleak Dodona's vocal hill:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Whose groves the Selli, race austere! surround,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their feet unwash'd, their slumbers on the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who hear, from rustling oaks, thy dark decrees;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And catch the fates, low-whispered in the breeze;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hear, as of old! Thou gav'st, at Thetis' prayer,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Glory to me, and to the Greeks despair.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo, to the dangers of the fighting field</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The best, the dearest of my friends, I yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though still determined, to my ships confined;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus gone, I stay but half behind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh! be his guard thy providential care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confirm his heart, and string his arm to war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Press'd by his single force let Hector see</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fame in arms not owing all to me.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when the fleets are saved from foes and fire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let him with conquest and renown retire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Preserve his arms, preserve his social train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And safe return him to these eyes again!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Jove consents to half the chief's request,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But heaven's eternal doom denies the rest;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To free the fleet was granted to his prayer;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His safe return, the winds dispersed in air.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Back to his tent the stern Achilles flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And waits the combat with impatient eyes.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile the troops beneath Patroclus' care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Invade the Trojans, and commence the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As wasps, provoked by children in their play,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their rising rage Patroclus' breath inspires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who thus inflames them with heroic fires:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">From shore to shore the doubling shouts resound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hollow ships return a deeper sound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The war stood still, and all around them gazed,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then first thy spear, divine Patroclus! flew,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fly diverse, scatter'd o'er the distant plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus' arm forbids the spreading fires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from the half-burn'd ship proud Troy retires;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Clear'd from the smoke the joyful navy lies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Triumphant Greece her rescued decks ascends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And loud acclaim the starry region rends.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So when thick clouds enwrap the mountain's head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er heaven's expanse like one black ceiling spread;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sudden the Thunderer, with a flashing ray,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bursts through the darkness, and lets down the day:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hills shine out, the rocks in prospect rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And streams, and vales, and forests, strike the eyes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The smiling scene wide opens to the sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all the unmeasured ether flames with light.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forced from the navy, yet the fight maintains.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now every Greek some hostile hero slew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But still the foremost, bold Patroclus flew:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As Areilycus had turn'd him round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The thigh transfix'd, and broke the brittle bone:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Headlong he fell. Next, Thoas was thy chance;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy breast, unarm'd, received the Spartan lance.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Phylides' dart (as Amphidus drew nigh)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In darkness, and in death, the warrior lay.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lycon the brave, and fierce Peneleus came;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain their javelins at each other flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now, met in arms, their eager swords they drew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On the plumed crest of his Boeotian foe</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The daring Lycon aim'd a noble blow;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sword broke short; but his, Peneleus sped</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the juncture of the neck and head:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The head, divided by a stroke so just,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hung by the skin; the body sunk to dust.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'ertaken Neamas by Merion bleeds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Back from the car he tumbles to the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His swimming eyes eternal shades surround.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next Erymas was doom'd his fate to feel,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His open'd mouth received the Cretan steel:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath the brain the point a passage tore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Crash'd the thin bones, and drown'd the teeth in gore:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His mouth, his eyes, his nostrils, pour a flood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sobs his soul out in the gush of blood.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when the flocks neglected by the swain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or kids, or lambs, lie scatter'd o'er the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rend the trembling, unresisting prey:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy fled, unmindful of her former fame.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But still at Hector godlike Ajax aim'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still, pointed at his breast, his javelin flamed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojan chief, experienced in the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Observed the storm of darts the Grecians pour,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And on his buckler caught the ringing shower:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sees for Greece the scale of conquest rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet stops, and turns, and saves his loved allies.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dark o'er the fields the ascending vapour flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And shades the sun, and blots the golden skies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So from the ships, along the dusky plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dire Flight and Terror drove the Trojan train.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even Hector fled; through heads of disarray</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fiery coursers forced their lord away:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While far behind his Trojans fall confused;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Chariots on chariots roll: the clashing spokes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shock; while the madding steeds break short their yokes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain they labour up the steepy mound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their charioteers lie foaming on the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce on the rear, with shouts Patroclus flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Clouds rise on clouds, and heaven is snatch'd from sight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scour o'er the fields, and stretch to reach the town.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud o'er the rout was heard the victor's cry,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where the war bleeds, and where the thickest die,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where horse and arms, and chariots he o'erthrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bleeding heroes under axles groan.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No stop, no check, the steeds of Peleus knew:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From bank to bank the immortal coursers flew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High-bounding o'er the fosse, the whirling car</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Smokes through the ranks, o'ertakes the flying war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thunders after Hector; Hector flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus shakes his lance; but fate denies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not with less noise, with less impetuous force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The tide of Trojans urge their desperate course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Than when in autumn Jove his fury pours,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And earth is loaden with incessant showers;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(When guilty mortals break the eternal laws,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or judges, bribed, betray the righteous cause;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From their deep beds he bids the rivers rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And opens all the flood-gates of the skies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The impetuous torrents from their hills obey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whole fields are drown'd, and mountains swept away;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud roars the deluge till it meets the main;</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now the chief (the foremost troops repell'd)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Back to the ships his destined progress held,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bore down half Troy in his resistless way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And forced the routed ranks to stand the day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Between the space where silver Simois flows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where lay the fleets, and where the rampires rose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All grim in dust and blood Patroclus stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And turns the slaughter on the conquering bands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First Pronous died beneath his fiery dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which pierced below the shield his valiant heart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thestor was next, who saw the chief appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fell the victim of his coward fear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shrunk up he sat, with wild and haggard eye,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor stood to combat, nor had force to fly;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus mark'd him as he shunn'd the war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And with unmanly tremblings shook the car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dropp'd the flowing reins. Him 'twixt the jaws,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The javelin sticks, and from the chariot draws.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As on a rock that overhangs the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">An angler, studious of the line and cane,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some mighty fish draws panting to the shore:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not with less ease the barbed javelin bore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gaping dastard; as the spear was shook,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He fell, and life his heartless breast forsook.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next on Eryalus he flies; a stone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Large as a rock, was by his fury thrown:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And burst the helm, and cleft the head in two:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And death involved him with the shades of hell.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then low in dust Epaltes, Echius, lie;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ipheas, Evippus, Polymelus, die;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amphoterus and Erymas succeed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where'er he moves, the growing slaughters spread</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In heaps on heaps a monument of dead.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When now Sarpedon his brave friends beheld</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Grovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With this reproach his flying host he warms:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forsake, inglorious, the contended plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This hand unaided shall the war sustain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The task be mine this hero's strength to try,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who mows whole troops, and makes an army fly."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus lights, and sternly waits the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when two vultures on the mountain's height</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stoop with resounding pinions to the fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The desert echoes, and the rocks reply:</l>
<pb n="300" /><anchor id="Pg300" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warriors thus opposed in arms, engage</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With equal clamours, and with equal rage.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove view'd the combat: whose event foreseen,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He thus bespoke his sister and his queen:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"The hour draws on; the destinies ordain,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">The destinies ordain.</hi>—"In the mythology, also, of the
Iliad, purely Pagan as it is, we discover one important truth
unconsciously involved, which was almost entirely lost from view
amidst the nearly equal scepticism and credulity of subsequent ages.
Zeus or Jupiter is popularly to be taken as omnipotent. No distinct
empire is assigned to fate or fortune; the will of the father of gods
and men is absolute and uncontrollable. This seems to be the true
character of the Homeric deity, and it is very necessary that the
student of Greek literature should bear it constantly in mind. A strong
instance in the Iliad itself to illustrate this position, is the
passage where Jupiter laments to Juno the approaching death of
Sarpedon. 'Alas me!' says he 'since it is fated (moira) that Sarpedon,
dearest to me of men, should be slain by Patroclus, the son of
Menoetius! Indeed, my heart is divided within me while I ruminate it in
my mind, whether having snatched him up from out of the lamentable
battle, I should not at once place him alive in the fertile land of his
own Lycia, or whether I should now destroy him by the hands of the son
of Menoetius!' To which Juno answers—'Dost thou mean to rescue from
death a mortal man, long since destined by fate (palai pepromenon)?
You may do it—but we, the rest of the gods, do not sanction it.' Here
it is clear from both speakers, that although Sarpedon is said to be
fated to die, Jupiter might still, if he pleased, save him, and place
him entirely out of the reach of any such event, and further, in the
alternative, that Jupiter himself would destroy him by the hands of
another."—Coleridge, p. 156. seq.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already on the verge of death he stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His life is owed to fierce Patroclus' hands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What passions in a parent's breast debate!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Say, shall I snatch him from impending fate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And send him safe to Lycia, distant far</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From all the dangers and the toils of war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or to his doom my bravest offspring yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fatten, with celestial blood, the field?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What words are these, O sovereign of the skies!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Short is the date prescribed to mortal man;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall Jove for one extend the narrow span,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose bounds were fix'd before his race began?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How many sons of gods, foredoom'd to death,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before proud Ilion must resign their breath!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Were thine exempt, debate would rise above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And when the ascending soul has wing'd her flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let Sleep and Death convey, by thy command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The breathless body to his native land.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His friends and people, to his future praise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A marble tomb and pyramid shall raise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lasting honours to his ashes give;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fame ('tis all the dead can have) shall live."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She said: the cloud-compeller, overcome,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Assents to fate, and ratifies the doom.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then touch'd with grief, the weeping heavens distill'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A shower of blood o'er all the fatal field:</l>
<pb n="301" /><anchor id="Pg301" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god, his eyes averting from the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Laments his son, predestined to be slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far from the Lycian shores, his happy native reign.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now met in arms, the combatants appear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From strong Patroclus' hand the javelin fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pass'd the groin of valiant Thrasymed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He falls, and falling bites the bloody plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two sounding darts the Lycian leader threw:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The first aloof with erring fury flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The next transpierced Achilles' mortal steed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The generous Pedasus of Theban breed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd in the shoulder's joint, he reel'd around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Roll'd in the bloody dust, and paw'd the slippery ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His sudden fall the entangled harness broke;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each axle crackled, and the chariot shook:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When bold Automedon, to disengage</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The starting coursers, and restrain their rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Divides the traces with his sword, and freed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The encumbered chariot from the dying steed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rest move on, obedient to the rein:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The car rolls slowly o'er the dusty plain.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And first Sarpedon whirl'd his weighty lance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And spent in empty air its dying force.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so Patroclus' never-erring dart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Aim'd at his breast it pierced a mortal part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where the strong fibres bind the solid heart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or pine (fit mast for some great admiral)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before his chariot stretch'd his form divine:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He grasp'd the dust distain'd with streaming gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So lies a bull beneath the lion's paws,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then to the leader of the Lycian band</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dying chief address'd his last command;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The glorious dangers of destructive war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To lead my troops, to combat at their head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Incite the living, and supply the dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tell them, I charged them with my latest breath</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not unrevenged to bear Sarpedon's death.</l>
<pb n="302" /><anchor id="Pg302" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If these spoil'd arms adorn a Grecian foe!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then as a friend, and as a warrior fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Defend my body, conquer in my right:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That, taught by great examples, all may try</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like thee to vanquish, or like me to die."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ceased; the Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his eyes darken'd with the shades of death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The insulting victor with disdain bestrode</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then drew the weapon from his panting heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The reeking fibres clinging to the dart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the wide wound gush'd out a stream of blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the soul issued in the purple flood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His flying steeds the Myrmidons detain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unguided now, their mighty master slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All-impotent of aid, transfix'd with grief,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His painful arm, yet useless with the smart</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Inflicted late by Teucer's deadly dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Supported on his better hand he stay'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Phoebus then ('twas all he could) he pray'd:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia's coast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or sacred Ilion, thy bright presence boast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Powerful alike to ease the wretch's smart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O hear me! god of every healing art!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I stand unable to sustain the spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sigh, at distance from the glorious war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Low in the dust is great Sarpedon laid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But thou, O god of health! thy succour lend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guard the relics of my slaughter'd friend:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For thou, though distant, canst restore my might,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To head my Lycians, and support the fight."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Apollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His heavenly hand restrain'd the flux of blood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He drew the dolours from the wounded part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And breathed a spirit in his rising heart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Renew'd by art divine, the hero stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And owns the assistance of immortal hands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First to the fight his native troops he warms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then loudly calls on Troy's vindictive arms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With ample strides he stalks from place to place;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now fires Agenor, now Polydamas:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Æneas next, and Hector he accosts;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy!</l>
<pb n="303" /><anchor id="Pg303" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those generous friends, who, from their country far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Breathe their brave souls out in another's war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">See! where in dust the great Sarpedon lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In action valiant, and in council wise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who guarded right, and kept his people free;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To all his Lycians lost, and lost to thee!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd by Patroclus' arm on yonder plains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O save from hostile rage his loved remains!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah let not Greece his conquer'd trophies boast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke: each leader in his grief partook:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy, at the loss, through all her legions shook.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Transfix'd with deep regret, they view o'erthrown</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once his country's pillar, and their own;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A chief, who led to Troy's beleaguer'd wall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A host of heroes, and outshined them all.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And with superior vengeance greatly glows.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But o'er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies pale in death, extended on the field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guard his body Troy in numbers flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tis half the glory to maintain our prize.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste, strip his arms, the slaughter round him spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And send the living Lycians to the dead."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The heroes kindle at his fierce command;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The martial squadrons close on either hand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thessalia there, and Greece, oppose their arms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With horrid shouts they circle round the slain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The clash of armour rings o'er all the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er the fierce armies pours pernicious night,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And round his son confounds the warring hosts,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now Greece gives way, and great Epigeus falls;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Agacleus' son, from Budium's lofty walls;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who chased for murder thence a suppliant came</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Peleus, and the silver-footed dame;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now sent to Troy, Achilles' arms to aid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He pays due vengeance to his kinsman's shade.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as his luckless hand had touch'd the dead,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A rock's large fragment thunder'd on his head;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hurl'd by Hectorean force it cleft in twain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His shatter'd helm, and stretch'd him o'er the slain.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce to the van of fight Patroclus came,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, like an eagle darting at his game,</l>
<pb n="304" /><anchor id="Pg304" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O generous Greek! when with full vigour thrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which sunk him to the dead: when Troy, too near</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That arm, drew back; and Hector learn'd to fear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far as an able hand a lance can throw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or at the lists, or at the fighting foe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So far the Trojans from their lines retired;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The only hope of Chalcon's trembling age;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wide o'er the land was stretch'd his large domain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With stately seats, and riches blest in vain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him, bold with youth, and eager to pursue</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flying Lycians, Glaucus met and slew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He fell, and falling made the fields resound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Achaians sorrow for their heroes slain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And crowd to spoil the dead: the Greeks oppose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">An iron circle round the carcase grows.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then brave Laogonus resign'd his breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Despatch'd by Merion to the shades of death:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On Ida's holy hill he made abode,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The priest of Jove, and honour'd like his god.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Between the jaw and ear the javelin went;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The soul, exhaling, issued at the vent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His spear Aeneas at the victor threw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who stooping forward from the death withdrew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lance hiss'd harmless o'er his covering shield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And trembling struck, and rooted in the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sent by the great Aeneas' arm in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Swift as thou art (the raging hero cries)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And skill'd in dancing to dispute the prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My spear, the destined passage had it found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had fix'd thy active vigour to the ground."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O valiant leader of the Dardan host!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Insulted Merion thus retorts the boast)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Strong as you are, 'tis mortal force you trust,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">An arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And if to this my lance thy fate be given,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain are thy vaunts; success is still from heaven:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This, instant, sends thee down to Pluto's coast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mine is the glory, his thy parting ghost."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O friend (Menoetius' son this answer gave)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With words to combat, ill befits the brave;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not empty boasts the sons of Troy repel,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your swords must plunge them to the shades of hell.</l>
<pb n="305" /><anchor id="Pg305" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To speak, beseems the council; but to dare</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In glorious action, is the task of war."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, Patroclus to the battle flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Merion follows, and new shouts arise:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shields, helmets rattle, as the warriors close;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As through the shrilling vale, or mountain ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The labours of the woodman's axe resound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Blows following blows are heard re-echoing wide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While crackling forests fall on every side:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus echoed all the fields with loud alarms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So fell the warriors, and so rung their arms.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now great Sarpedon on the sandy shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His heavenly form defaced with dust and gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stuck with darts by warring heroes shed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies undistinguish'd from the vulgar dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His long-disputed corse the chiefs enclose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On every side the busy combat grows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thick as beneath some shepherd's thatch'd abode</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The pails high foaming with a milky flood)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The buzzing flies, a persevering train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Incessant swarm, and chased return again.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove view'd the combat with a stern survey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And eyes that flash'd intolerable day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd on the field his sight, his breast debates</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The vengeance due, and meditates the fates:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whether to urge their prompt effect, and call</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The force of Hector to Patroclus' fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This instant see his short-lived trophies won,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stretch him breathless on his slaughter'd son;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or yet, with many a soul's untimely flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Augment the fame and horror of the fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To crown Achilles' valiant friend with praise</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At length he dooms; and, that his last of days</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall set in glory, bids him drive the foe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor unattended see the shades below.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Hector's mind he fills with dire dismay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He mounts his car, and calls his hosts away;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sunk with Troy's heavy fates, he sees decline</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The scales of Jove, and pants with awe divine.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, nor before, the hardy Lycians fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And left their monarch with the common dead:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around, in heaps on heaps, a dreadful wall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of carnage rises, as the heroes fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(So Jove decreed!) At length the Greeks obtain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prize contested, and despoil the slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The radiant arms are by Patroclus borne;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus' ships the glorious spoils adorn.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus to Phoebus, in the realms above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spoke from his throne the cloud-compelling Jove:</l>
<pb n="306" /><anchor id="Pg306" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Descend, my Phoebus! on the Phrygian plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from the fight convey Sarpedon slain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then bathe his body in the crystal flood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with blood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And with celestial robes adorn the dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those rites discharged, his sacred corse bequeath</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the soft arms of silent Sleep and Death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They to his friends the immortal charge shall bear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What honour mortals after death receive,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those unavailing honours we may give!"</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Apollo bows, and from mount Ida's height,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift to the field precipitates his flight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thence from the war the breathless hero bore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Veil'd in a cloud, to silver Simois' shore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There bathed his honourable wounds, and dress'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His manly members in the immortal vest;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Restores his freshness, and his form renews.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Sleep and Death, two twins of winged race,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of matchless swiftness, but of silent pace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Received Sarpedon, at the god's command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in a moment reach'd the Lycian land;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The corse amidst his weeping friends they laid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where endless honours wait the sacred shade.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile Patroclus pours along the plains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With foaming coursers, and with loosen'd reins.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce on the Trojan and the Lycian crew,</l>
<pb n="307" /><anchor id="Pg307" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah blind to fate! thy headlong fury flew</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against what fate and powerful Jove ordain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain was thy friend's command, thy courage vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For he, the god, whose counsels uncontroll'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dismay the mighty, and confound the bold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god who gives, resumes, and orders all,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He urged thee on, and urged thee on to fall.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who first, brave hero! by that arm was slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who last beneath thy vengeance press'd the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When heaven itself thy fatal fury led,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And call'd to fill the number of the dead?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Adrestus first; Autonous then succeeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Echeclus follows; next young Megas bleeds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Epistor, Melanippus, bite the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The slaughter, Elasus and Mulius crown'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then sunk Pylartes to eternal night;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now Troy had stoop'd beneath his matchless power,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But flaming Phoebus kept the sacred tower</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrice at the battlements Patroclus strook;<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Thrice at the battlements.</hi> "The art military of the
Homeric age is upon a level with the state of navigation just
described, personal prowess decided every thing; the night attack and
the ambuscade, although much esteemed, were never upon a large scale.
The chiefs fight in advance, and enact almost as much as the knights of
romance. The siege of Troy was as little like a modern siege as a
captain in the guards is like Achilles. There is no mention of a ditch
or any other line or work round the town, and the wall itself was
accessible without a ladder. It was probably a vast mound of earth with
a declivity outwards. Patroclus thrice mounts it in armour. The Trojans
are in no respects blockaded, and receive assistance from their allies
to the very end."—Coleridge, p. 212.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His blazing aegis thrice Apollo shook;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Patroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Defies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy shall not stoop even to Achilles' hand."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So spoke the god who darts celestial fires;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greek obeys him, and with awe retires.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Hector, checking at the Scaean gates</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His panting coursers, in his breast debates,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or in the field his forces to employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus while he thought, beside him Phoebus stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In Asius' shape, who reigned by Sangar's flood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus he accosts him. "What a shameful sight!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">God! is it Hector that forbears the fight?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Were thine my vigour this successful spear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should soon convince thee of so false a fear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,</l>
<pb n="308" /><anchor id="Pg308" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in Patroclus' blood efface thy shame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He bids Cebrion drive the rapid car;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lash resounds, the coursers rush to war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god the Grecians' sinking souls depress'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pour'd swift spirits through each Trojan breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus lights, impatient for the fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A spear his left, a stone employs his right:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With all his nerves he drives it at the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pointed above, and rough and gross below:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The falling ruin crush'd Cebrion's head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lawless offspring of king Priam's bed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish'd wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The charioteer, while yet he held the rein,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the proud victor thus his fall derides.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What skilful divers are our Phrygian foes!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mark with what ease they sink into the sand!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pity that all their practice is by land!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift as a lion, terrible and bold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from his fatal courage finds his bane.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once bold Hector leaping from his car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Defends the body, and provokes the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus for some slaughter'd hind, with equal rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two lordly rulers of the wood engage;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And echoing roars rebellow through the shades.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern Hector fastens on the warrior's head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While all around, confusion, rage, and fright,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This way and that, the rattling thicket bends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the whole forest in one crash descends.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Darts shower'd on darts, now round the carcase ring;</l>
<pb n="309" /><anchor id="Pg309" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now flights of arrows bounding from the string:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, stretch'd in death, forgets the guiding reins!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While on each host with equal tempests fell</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when his evening wheels o'erhung the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Glad conquest rested on the Grecian train.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then from amidst the tumult and alarms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They draw the conquer'd corse and radiant arms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thrice three heroes at each onset slew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There ends thy glory! there the Fates untwine</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The last, black remnant of so bright a line:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Apollo dreadful stops thy middle way;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Death calls, and heaven allows no longer day!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Approaching dealt a staggering blow behind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His eyes flash sparkles, his stunn'd senses reel</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In giddy darkness; far to distance flung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His bounding helmet on the champaign rung.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles' plume is stain'd with dust and gore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That plume which never stoop'd to earth before;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long used, untouch'd, in fighting fields to shine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And shade the temples of the mad divine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove dooms it now on Hector's helm to nod;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not long—for fate pursues him, and the god.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His spear in shivers falls; his ample shield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The corslet his astonish'd breast forsakes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such is the force of more than mortal hands!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A Dardan youth there was, well known to fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Famed for the manage of the foaming horse,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Skill'd in the dart, and matchless in the course:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full twenty knights he tumbled from the car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While yet he learn'd his rudiments of war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His venturous spear first drew the hero's gore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor, though disarm'd, Patroclus' fury stood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But swift withdrew the long-protended wood.</l>
<pb n="310" /><anchor id="Pg310" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And turn'd him short, and herded in the crowd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Retires for succour to his social train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lance arrests him with a mortal wound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With him all Greece was sunk; that moment all</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her yet-surviving heroes seem'd to fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So, scorch'd with heat, along the desert score,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The roaming lion meets a bristly boar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With flaming eyes, and jaws besmear'd with blood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At length the sovereign savage wins the strife;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o'erthrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So many lives effused, expires his own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As dying now at Hector's feet he lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sternly views him, and triumphant cries:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee, the joy</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy pride once promised, of subverting Troy;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unthinking man! I fought those towers to free,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And guard that beauteous race from lords like thee:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But thou a prey to vultures shalt be made;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy own Achilles cannot lend thee aid;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though much at parting that great chief might say,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And much enjoin thee, this important day.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Return not, my brave friend (perhaps he said),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.'</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, Patroclus march'd, and thus he sped."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Supine, and wildly gazing on the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With faint, expiring breath, the chief replies:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove's and Apollo's is this deed, not thine;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To heaven is owed whate'er your own you call,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heaven itself disarm'd me ere my fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had twenty mortals, each thy match in might,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By fate and Phoebus was I first o'erthrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Euphorbus next; the third mean part thy own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But thou, imperious! hear my latest breath;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gods inspire it, and it sounds thy death:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Insulting man, thou shalt be soon as I;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Black fate o'erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even now on life's last verge I see thee stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I see thee fall, and by Achilles' hand."</l>
</lg>

<pb n="311" /><anchor id="Pg311" />

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He faints: the soul unwilling wings her way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The beauteous body left a load of clay)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Flits to the lone, uncomfortable coast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Hector pausing, as his eyes he fed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On the pale carcase, thus address'd the dead:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"From whence this boding speech, the stern decree</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of death denounced, or why denounced to me?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Why not as well Achilles' fate be given</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Hector's lance? Who knows the will of heaven?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pensive he said; then pressing as he lay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His breathless bosom, tore the lance away;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And upwards cast the corse: the reeking spear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He shakes, and charges the bold charioteer.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But swift Automedon with loosen'd reins</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rapt in the chariot o'er the distant plains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far from his rage the immortal coursers drove;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The immortal coursers were the gift of Jove.</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE SEVENTH BATTLE, FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.—THE ACTS OF MENELAUS.</p>

<p>Menelaus, upon the death of Patroclus, defends his body from the enemy:
Euphorbus, who attempts it, is slain. Hector advancing, Menelaus
retires; but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him off. This, Glaucus
objects to Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had
won from Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till
Ajax rallies them: Aeneas sustains the Trojans. Aeneas and Hector
Attempt the chariot of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The
horses of Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his
body with a thick darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion.
Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus'
death: then returns to the fight, where, though attacked with the
utmost fury, he and Meriones, assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body
to the ships.</p>

<p>The time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene lies
in the fields before Troy.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Menelaus, touch'd with generous woe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Springs to the front, and guards him from the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus round her new-fallen young the heifer moves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Turns, and re-turns her, with a mother's care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Opposed to each that near the carcase came,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Panthus, skill'd the dart to send,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eyes the dead hero, and insults the friend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Warrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To me the spoils my prowess won, resign:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Depart with life, and leave the glory mine"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With generous anguish, and in scorn return'd:</l>
<pb n="313" /><anchor id="Pg313" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Laugh'st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When mortals boast of prowess not their own?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not thus the lion glories in his might,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Man only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But far the vainest of the boastful kind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet 'twas but late, beneath my conquering steel</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This boaster's brother, Hyperenor, fell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against our arm which rashly he defied,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These eyes beheld him on the dust expire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Presumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or, while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unmoved, Euphorbus thus: "That action known,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Come, for my brother's blood repay thy own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His weeping father claims thy destined head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And spouse, a widow in her bridal bed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On these thy conquer'd spoils I shall bestow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To soothe a consort's and a parent's woe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No longer then defer the glorious strife,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let heaven decide our fortune, fame, and life."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift as the word the missile lance he flings;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The well-aim'd weapon on the buckler rings,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But blunted by the brass, innoxious falls.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On Jove the father great Atrides calls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wide through the neck appears the grisly wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone sinks the warrior, and his arms resound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shining circlets of his golden hair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which even the Graces might be proud to wear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Instarr'd with gems and gold, bestrow the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with gore.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As the young olive, in some sylvan scene,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Crown'd by fresh fountains with eternal green,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And plays and dances to the gentle air;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The tender plant, and withers all its shades;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It lies uprooted from its genial bed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A lovely ruin now defaced and dead:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the fierce Spartan tore his arms away.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proud of his deed, and glorious in the prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Affrighted Troy the towering victor flies:</l>
<pb n="314" /><anchor id="Pg314" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Flies, as before some mountain lion's ire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The village curs and trembling swains retire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When o'er the slaughter'd bull they hear him roar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And see his jaws distil with smoking gore:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All pale with fear, at distance scatter'd round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They shout incessant, and the vales resound.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile Apollo view'd with envious eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And urged great Hector to dispute the prize;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(In Mentes' shape, beneath whose martial care</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rough Ciconians learn'd the trade of war;)<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Ciconians.</hi>—A people of Thrace, near the Hebrus.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Forbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chase</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles' coursers, of ethereal race;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They stoop not, these, to mortal man's command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or stoop to none but great Achilles' hand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Too long amused with a pursuit so vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Turn, and behold the brave Euphorbus slain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Sparta slain! for ever now suppress'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fire which burn'd in that undaunted breast!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus having spoke, Apollo wing'd his flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And mix'd with mortals in the toils of fight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His words infix'd unutterable care</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep in great Hector's soul: through all the war</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He darts his anxious eye; and, instant, view'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The breathless hero in his blood imbued,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Forth welling from the wound, as prone he lay)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in the victor's hands the shining prey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sheath'd in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sends his voice in thunder to the skies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It flew, and fired the nations as it went.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Atrides from the voice the storm divined,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus explored his own unconquer'd mind:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Then shall I quit Patroclus on the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Slain in my cause, and for my honour slain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Desert the arms, the relics, of my friend?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or singly, Hector and his troops attend?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sure where such partial favour heaven bestow'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To brave the hero were to brave the god:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forgive me, Greece, if once I quit the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis not to Hector, but to heaven I yield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet, nor the god, nor heaven, should give me fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Did but the voice of Ajax reach my ear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still would we turn, still battle on the plains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And give Achilles all that yet remains</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of his and our Patroclus—" This, no more</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The time allow'd: Troy thicken'd on the shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sable scene! The terrors Hector led.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Slow he recedes, and sighing quits the dead.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So from the fold the unwilling lion parts,</l>
<pb n="315" /><anchor id="Pg315" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forced by loud clamours, and a storm of darts;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He flies indeed, but threatens as he flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With heart indignant and retorted eyes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now enter'd in the Spartan ranks, he turn'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His manly breast, and with new fury burn'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er all the black battalions sent his view,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And through the cloud the godlike Ajax knew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where labouring on the left the warrior stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All grim in arms, and cover'd o'er with blood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There breathing courage, where the god of day</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had sunk each heart with terror and dismay.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him the king: "Oh Ajax, oh my friend!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste, and Patroclus' loved remains defend:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The body to Achilles to restore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Demands our care; alas, we can no more!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For naked now, despoiled of arms, he lies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Hector glories in the dazzling prize."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and touch'd his heart. The raging pair</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already had stern Hector seized his head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And doom'd to Trojan gods the unhappy dead;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But soon as Ajax rear'd his tower-like shield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung to his car, and measured back the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His train to Troy the radiant armour bear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To stand a trophy of his fame in war.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile great Ajax (his broad shield display'd)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now before, and now behind he stood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus in the centre of some gloomy wood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With many a step, the lioness surrounds</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her tawny young, beset by men and hounds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Elate her heart, and rousing all her powers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dark o'er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fast by his side the generous Spartan glows</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With great revenge, and feeds his inward woes.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On Hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Where now in Hector shall we Hector find?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A manly form, without a manly mind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is this, O chief! a hero's boasted fame?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How vain, without the merit, is the name!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Since battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What other methods may preserve thy Troy:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis time to try if Ilion's state can stand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mean, empty boast! but shall the Lycians stake</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their lives for you? those Lycians you forsake?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What from thy thankless arms can we expect?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Say, shall our slaughter'd bodies guard your walls,</l>
<pb n="316" /><anchor id="Pg316" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While unreveng'd the great Sarpedon falls?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even where he died for Troy, you left him there,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On my command if any Lycian wait,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hence let him march, and give up Troy to fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Did such a spirit as the gods impart</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Impel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Such as should burn in every soul that draws</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sword for glory, and his country's cause)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even yet our mutual arms we might employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh! were Patroclus ours, we might obtain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sarpedon's arms and honour'd corse again!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece with Achilles' friend should be repaid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus due honours purchased to his shade.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But words are vain—Let Ajax once appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Hector trembles and recedes with fear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou dar'st not meet the terrors of his eye;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lo! already thou prepar'st to fly."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojan chief with fix'd resentment eyed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Lycian leader, and sedate replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Say, is it just, my friend, that Hector's ear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From such a warrior such a speech should hear?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I deem'd thee once the wisest of thy kind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But ill this insult suits a prudent mind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I shun great Ajax? I desert my train?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I joy to mingle where the battle bleeds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Jove's high will is ever uncontroll'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The strong he withers, and confounds the bold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now crowns with fame the mighty man, and now</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Strikes the fresh garland from the victor's brow!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Come, through yon squadrons let us hew the way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thou be witness, if I fear to-day;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If yet a Greek the sight of Hector dread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or yet their hero dare defend the dead."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then turning to the martial hosts, he cries:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, and allies!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be men, my friends, in action as in name,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And yet be mindful of your ancient fame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector in proud Achilles' arms shall shine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Torn from his friend, by right of conquest mine."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He strode along the field, as thus he said:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The sable plumage nodded o'er his head:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift through the spacious plain he sent a look;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One instant saw, one instant overtook</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The distant band, that on the sandy shore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There his own mail unbraced the field bestrow'd;</l>
<pb n="317" /><anchor id="Pg317" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His train to Troy convey'd the massy load.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now blazing in the immortal arms he stands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The work and present of celestial hands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By aged Peleus to Achilles given,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As first to Peleus by the court of heaven:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His father's arms not long Achilles wears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forbid by fate to reach his father's years.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him, proud in triumph, glittering from afar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god whose thunder rends the troubled air</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beheld with pity; as apart he sat,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, conscious, look'd through all the scene of fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He shook the sacred honours of his head;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Olympus trembled, and the godhead said;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ah, wretched man! unmindful of thy end!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A moment's glory; and what fates attend!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In heavenly panoply divinely bright</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou stand'st, and armies tremble at thy sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As at Achilles' self! beneath thy dart</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies slain the great Achilles' dearer part.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which once the greatest of mankind had worn.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet live! I give thee one illustrious day,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A blaze of glory ere thou fad'st away.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For ah! no more Andromache shall come</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With joyful tears to welcome Hector home;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more officious, with endearing charms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides' arms!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then with his sable brow he gave the nod</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That seals his word; the sanction of the god.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stubborn arms (by Jove's command disposed)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Conform'd spontaneous, and around him closed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fill'd with the god, enlarged his members grew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through all his veins a sudden vigour flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The blood in brisker tides began to roll,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Mars himself came rushing on his soul.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Exhorting loud through all the field he strode,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And look'd, and moved, Achilles, or a god.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, he inspires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now Phorcys, Chromius, and Hippothous fires;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great Thersilochus like fury found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Asteropaeus kindled at the sound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Ennomus, in augury renown'd.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hear, all ye hosts, and hear, unnumber'd bands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of neighbouring nations, or of distant lands!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Twas not for state we summon'd you so far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To boast our numbers, and the pomp of war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ye came to fight; a valiant foe to chase,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To save our present, and our future race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tor this, our wealth, our products, you enjoy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And glean the relics of exhausted Troy.</l>
<pb n="318" /><anchor id="Pg318" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now then, to conquer or to die prepare;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To die or conquer are the terms of war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whatever hand shall win Patroclus slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whoe'er shall drag him to the Trojan train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With Hector's self shall equal honours claim;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With Hector part the spoil, and share the fame."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They join, they thicken, they protend their spears;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the Greeks they drive in firm array,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And each from Ajax hopes the glorious prey:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain hope! what numbers shall the field o'erspread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What victims perish round the mighty dead!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Ajax mark'd the growing storm from far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus bespoke his brother of the war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Our fatal day, alas! is come, my friend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all our wars and glories at an end!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis not this corse alone we guard in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Condemn'd to vultures on the Trojan plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">We too must yield: the same sad fate must fall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On thee, on me, perhaps, my friend, on all.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">See what a tempest direful Hector spreads,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lo! it bursts, it thunders on our heads!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Call on our Greeks, if any hear the call,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bravest Greeks: this hour demands them all."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior raised his voice, and wide around</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The field re-echoed the distressful sound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O chiefs! O princes, to whose hand is given</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rule of men; whose glory is from heaven!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom with due honours both Atrides grace:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ye guides and guardians of our Argive race!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All, whom this well-known voice shall reach from far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All, whom I see not through this cloud of war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Come all! let generous rage your arms employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And save Patroclus from the dogs of Troy."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oilean Ajax first the voice obey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift was his pace, and ready was his aid:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next him Idomeneus, more slow with age,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Merion, burning with a hero's rage.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The long-succeeding numbers who can name?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But all were Greeks, and eager all for fame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce to the charge great Hector led the throng;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whole Troy embodied rush'd with shouts along.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus, when a mountain billow foams and raves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where some swoln river disembogues his waves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full in the mouth is stopp'd the rushing tide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The boiling ocean works from side to side,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The river trembles to his utmost shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And distant rocks re-bellow to the roar.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor less resolved, the firm Achaian band</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With brazen shields in horrid circle stand.</l>
<pb n="319" /><anchor id="Pg319" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove, pouring darkness o'er the mingled fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Conceals the warriors' shining helms in night:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him, the chief for whom the hosts contend</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had lived not hateful, for he lived a friend:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dead he protects him with superior care.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor dooms his carcase to the birds of air.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The first attack the Grecians scarce sustain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Repulsed, they yield; the Trojans seize the slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then fierce they rally, to revenge led on</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By the swift rage of Ajax Telamon.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Ajax to Peleus' son the second name,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In graceful stature next, and next in fame)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With headlong force the foremost ranks he tore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So through the thicket bursts the mountain boar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rudely scatters, for a distance round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The frighted hunter and the baying hound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Lethus, brave Pelasgus' heir,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hippothous, dragg'd the carcase through the war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sinewy ankles bored, the feet he bound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With thongs inserted through the double wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Inevitable fate o'ertakes the deed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Doom'd by great Ajax' vengeful lance to bleed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It cleft the helmet's brazen cheeks in twain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shatter'd crest and horse-hair strow the plain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With nerves relax'd he tumbles to the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He drops Patroclus' foot, and o'er him spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now lies a sad companion of the dead:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far from Larissa lies, his native air,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And ill requites his parents' tender care.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lamented youth! in life's first bloom he fell,</l>
<pb n="320" /><anchor id="Pg320" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Once more at Ajax Hector's javelin flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Grecian marking, as it cut the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shunn'd the descending death; which hissing on,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd in the dust the great Iphytus' son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Schedius the brave, of all the Phocian kind</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The boldest warrior and the noblest mind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In little Panope, for strength renown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He held his seat, and ruled the realms around.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Plunged in his throat, the weapon drank his blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In clanging arms the hero fell and all</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fields resounded with his weighty fall.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Phorcys, as slain Hippothous he defends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Telamonian lance his belly rends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hollow armour burst before the stroke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And through the wound the rushing entrails broke:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In strong convulsions panting on the sands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck at the sight, recede the Trojan train:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shouting Argives strip the heroes slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now had Troy, by Greece compell'd to yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fled to her ramparts, and resign'd the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece, in her native fortitude elate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With Jove averse, had turn'd the scale of fate:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Phoebus urged Æneas to the fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He seem'd like aged Periphas to sight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(A herald in Anchises' love grown old,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Revered for prudence, and with prudence bold.)</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus he—"What methods yet, O chief! remain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There have been heroes, who, by virtuous care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By valour, numbers, and by arts of war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Have forced the powers to spare a sinking state,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gain'd at length the glorious odds of fate:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His partial favour, and assists your wars,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your shameful efforts 'gainst yourselves employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And force the unwilling god to ruin Troy."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Æneas through the form assumed descries</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The power conceal'd, and thus to Hector cries:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Oh lasting shame! to our own fears a prey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">We seek our ramparts, and desert the day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A god, nor is he less, my bosom warms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And tells me, Jove asserts the Trojan arms."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and foremost to the combat flew:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bold example all his hosts pursue.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, first, Leocritus beneath him bled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain beloved by valiant Lycomede;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who view'd his fall, and, grieving at the chance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift to revenge it sent his angry lance;</l>
<pb n="321" /><anchor id="Pg321" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The whirling lance, with vigorous force address'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Descends, and pants in Apisaon's breast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From rich Paeonia's vales the warrior came,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next thee, Asteropeus! in place and fame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Asteropeus with grief beheld the slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rush'd to combat, but he rush'd in vain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Indissolubly firm, around the dead,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hemm'd with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A brazen bulwark, and an iron wood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Ajax eyes them with incessant care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in an orb contracts the crowded war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close in their ranks commands to fight or fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stands the centre and the soul of all:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd on the spot they war, and wounded, wound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece, in close order, and collected might,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In one thick darkness all the fight was lost;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seem'd as extinct: day ravish'd from their eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all heaven's splendours blotted from the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such o'er Patroclus' body hung the night,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rest in sunshine fought, and open light;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unclouded there, the aerial azure spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No vapour rested on the mountain's head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The golden sun pour'd forth a stronger ray,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all the broad expansion flamed with day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And here and there their scatter'd arrows light:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But death and darkness o'er the carcase spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There burn'd the war, and there the mighty bled.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When from the ships he sent the Pylian band.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youthful brothers thus for fame contend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor knew the fortune of Achilles' friend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In thought they view'd him still, with martial joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Glorious in arms, and dealing death to Troy.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But round the corse the heroes pant for breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thick and heavy grows the work of death:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'erlabour'd now, with dust, and sweat, and gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o'er;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.</l>
<pb n="322" /><anchor id="Pg322" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when a slaughter'd bull's yet reeking hide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Strain'd with full force, and tugg'd from side to side,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brawny curriers stretch; and labour o'er</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The extended surface, drunk with fat and gore:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So tugging round the corse both armies stood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now to the ships to force it, now to Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not Pallas' self, her breast when fury warms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor he whose anger sets the world in arms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Could blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such, Jove to honour the great dead ordain'd.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles in his ships at distance lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor knew the fatal fortune of the day;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He, yet unconscious of Patroclus' fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In dust extended under Ilion's wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Expects him glorious from the conquered plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And for his wish'd return prepares in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though well he knew, to make proud Ilion bend</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Was more than heaven had destined to his friend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Perhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rest, in pity to her son, conceal'd.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still raged the conflict round the hero dead,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Cursed be the man (even private Greeks would say)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who dares desert this well-disputed day!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First may the cleaving earth before our eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First perish all, ere haughty Troy shall boast</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">We lost Patroclus, and our glory lost!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus they: while with one voice the Trojans said,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Grant this day, Jove! or heap us on the dead!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then clash their sounding arms; the clangours rise,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor to the fight nor Hellespont they go,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Restive they stood, and obstinate in woe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still as a tombstone, never to be moved,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On some good man or woman unreproved</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lays its eternal weight; or fix'd, as stands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A marble courser by the sculptor's hands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Placed on the hero's grave. Along their face</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The big round drops coursed down with silent pace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Conglobing on the dust. Their manes, that late</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Circled their arched necks, and waved in state,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Trail'd on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And prone to earth was hung their languid head:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor Jove disdain'd to cast a pitying look,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thus relenting to the steeds he spoke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Unhappy coursers of immortal strain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Exempt from age, and deathless, now in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Did we your race on mortal man bestow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Only, alas! to share in mortal woe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For ah! what is there of inferior birth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What wretched creature of what wretched kind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Than man more weak, calamitous, and blind?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A miserable race! but cease to mourn:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For not by you shall Priam's son be borne</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on the splendid car: one glorious prize</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He rashly boasts: the rest our will denies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ourself with rising spirits swell your heart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Automedon your rapid flight shall bear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe to the navy through the storm of war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For yet 'tis given to Troy to ravage o'er</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The field, and spread her slaughters to the shore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sun shall see her conquer, till his fall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With sacred darkness shades the face of all."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said; and breathing in the immortal horse</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Excessive spirit, urged them to the course;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From their high manes they shake the dust, and bear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The kindling chariot through the parted war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So flies a vulture through the clamorous train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From danger now with swiftest speed they flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now to conquest with like speed pursue;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sole in the seat the charioteer remains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now plies the javelin, now directs the reins:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him brave Alcimedon beheld distress'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Approach'd the chariot, and the chief address'd:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What god provokes thee rashly thus to dare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alone, unaided, in the thickest war?</l>
<pb n="324" /><anchor id="Pg324" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alas! thy friend is slain, and Hector wields</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles' arms triumphant in the fields."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"In happy time (the charioteer replies)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No Greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or holds their fury in suspended reins:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus, while he lived, their rage could tame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But now Patroclus is an empty name!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To thee I yield the seat, to thee resign</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ruling charge: the task of fight be mine."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said. Alcimedon, with active heat,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Snatches the reins, and vaults into the seat.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His friend descends. The chief of Troy descried,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And call'd Æneas fighting near his side.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Lo, to my sight, beyond our hope restored,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles' car, deserted of its lord!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The glorious steeds our ready arms invite,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Can such opponents stand when we assail?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unite thy force, my friend, and we prevail."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Venus to the counsel yields;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then o'er their backs they spread their solid shields:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With brass refulgent the broad surface shined,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Them Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain advance! not fated to return.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unmov'd, Automedon attends the fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Implores the Eternal, and collects his might.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then turning to his friend, with dauntless mind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For hard the fight, determined is the foe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis Hector comes: and when he seeks the prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">War knows no mean; he wins it or he dies."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then through the field he sends his voice aloud,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With great Atrides. "Hither turn, (he said,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Turn where distress demands immediate aid;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dead, encircled by his friends, forego,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And save the living from a fiercer foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unhelp'd we stand, unequal to engage</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The force of Hector, and Æneas' rage:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet mighty as they are, my force to prove</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is only mine: the event belongs to Jove."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which pass'd the shield of Aretus the young:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It pierced his belt, emboss'd with curious art,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then in the lower belly struck the dart.</l>
<pb n="325" /><anchor id="Pg325" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when a ponderous axe, descending full,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Like to a bull, that with impetuous spring</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Darts, at the moment when the fatal blow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hath struck him, but unable to proceed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Plunges on either side."</l>
</lg>

<p rend="text-align: right">—Carey's Dante: Hell, c. xii.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck 'twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus fell the youth; the air his soul received,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now at Automedon the Trojan foe</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Discharged his lance; the meditated blow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stooping, he shunn'd; the javelin idly fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hiss'd innoxious o'er the hero's head;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In long vibrations spent its fury there.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But each brave Ajax heard, and interposed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor longer Hector with his Trojans stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But left their slain companion in his blood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His arms Automedon divests, and cries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Accept, Patroclus, this mean sacrifice:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus have I soothed my griefs, and thus have paid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Poor as it is, some offering to thy shade."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So looks the lion o'er a mangled boar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All grim with rage, and horrible with gore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on the chariot at one bound he sprung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And o'er his seat the bloody trophies hung.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now Minerva from the realms of air</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Descends impetuous, and renews the war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For, pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when high Jove denouncing future woe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">In such a form the goddess round her drew</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A livid cloud, and to the battle flew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Assuming Phoenix' shape on earth she falls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in his well-known voice to Sparta calls:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fills with keen revenge, with fell despite,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Desire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So burns the vengeful hornet (soul all o'er),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Repulsed in vain, and thirsty still of gore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Bold son of air and heat) on angry wings</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Untamed, untired, he turns, attacks, and stings.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fired with like ardour fierce Atrides flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sent his soul with every lance he threw.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Aetion's son, and Podes was his name:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With riches honour'd, and with courage bless'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Hector loved, his comrade, and his guest;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through his broad belt the spear a passage found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sudden at Hector's side Apollo stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like Phaenops, Asius' son, appear'd the god;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Asius the great, who held his wealthy reign</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In fair Abydos, by the rolling main.)</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Oh prince! (he cried) Oh foremost once in fame!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What Grecian now shall tremble at thy name?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dost thou at length to Menelaus yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A chief once thought no terror of the field?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet singly, now, the long-disputed prize</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He bears victorious, while our army flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By the same arm illustrious Podes bled;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The friend of Hector, unrevenged, is dead!"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This heard, o'er Hector spreads a cloud of woe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But now the Eternal shook his sable shield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That shaded Ide and all the subject field</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath its ample verge. A rolling cloud</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Involved the mount; the thunder roar'd aloud;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The affrighted hills from their foundations nod,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And blaze beneath the lightnings of the god:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At one regard of his all-seeing eye</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The vanquish'd triumph, and the victors fly.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For as the brave Boeotian turn'd his head</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To face the foe, Polydamas drew near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And razed his shoulder with a shorten'd spear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Grasps his once formidable lance in vain.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flaming javelin to his manly breast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brittle point before his corslet yields;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Exulting Troy with clamour fills the fields:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on his chariots the Cretan stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Priam whirl'd the massive wood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But erring from its aim, the impetuous spear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck to the dust the squire and charioteer</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of martial Merion: Coeranus his name,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On foot bold Merion fought; and now laid low,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But the brave squire the ready coursers brought,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And with his life his master's safety bought.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Between his cheek and ear the weapon went,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The teeth it shatter'd, and the tongue it rent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His dying hand forgets the falling rein:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This Merion reaches, bending from the car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And urges to desert the hopeless war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Idomeneus consents; the lash applies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the swift chariot to the navy flies.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not Ajax less the will of heaven descried,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whether the weak or strong discharge the dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He guides each arrow to a Grecian heart:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so our spears; incessant though they rain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He suffers every lance to fall in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deserted of the god, yet let us try</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What human strength and prudence can supply;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If yet this honour'd corse, in triumph borne,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And still hear Hector thundering at their gates.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some hero too must be despatch'd to bear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mournful message to Pelides' ear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For sure he knows not, distant on the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His friend, his loved Patroclus, is no more.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But such a chief I spy not through the host:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh king! Oh father! hear my humble prayer:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Give me to see, and Ajax asks no more:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If Greece must perish, we thy will obey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But let us perish in the face of day!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">So turns the lion from the nightly fold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though high in courage, and with hunger bold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long gall'd by herdsmen, and long vex'd by hounds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The darts fly round him from a hundred hands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the red terrors of the blazing brands:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till late, reluctant, at the dawn of day</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sour he departs, and quits the untasted prey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So moved Atrides from his dangerous place</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With weary limbs, but with unwilling pace;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The foe, he fear'd, might yet Patroclus gain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And much admonish'd, much adjured his train:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O guard these relics to your charge consign'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bear the merits of the dead in mind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How skill'd he was in each obliging art;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mildest manners, and the gentlest heart:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So parts the chief; from rank to rank he flew,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of all that wings the mid aerial sky,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sacred eagle, from his walks above</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Looks down, and sees the distant thicket move;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Snatches his life amid the clouds of air.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not with less quickness, his exerted sight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pass'd this and that way, through the ranks of fight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till on the left the chief he sought, he found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Cheering his men, and spreading deaths around:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him the king: "Beloved of Jove! draw near,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youthful warrior heard with silent woe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his fair eyes the tears began to flow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Big with the mighty grief, he strove to say</l>
<pb n="329" /><anchor id="Pg329" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What sorrow dictates, but no word found way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To brave Laodocus his arms he flung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then ran the mournful message to impart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Though sore distress'd) to aid the Pylian bands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Himself returns to his Patroclus slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Gone is Antilochus (the hero said);</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But hope not, warriors, for Achilles' aid:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unarm'd, he fights not with the Trojan foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis our own vigour must the dead regain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And save ourselves, while with impetuous hate</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy pours along, and this way rolls our fate."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"'Tis well (said Ajax), be it then thy care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With Merion's aid, the weighty corse to rear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Myself, and my bold brother will sustain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shock of Hector and his charging train:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor fear we armies, fighting side by side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What Troy can dare, we have already tried,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Have tried it, and have stood." The hero said.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High from the ground the warriors heave the dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A general clamour rises at the sight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Voracious hounds, that many a length before</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their furious hunters, drive the wounded boar;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But if the savage turns his glaring eye,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They howl aloof, and round the forest fly.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Ajax turning, to their fears they yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All pale they tremble and forsake the field.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thus aloft the hero's corse they bear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behind them rages all the storm of war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confusion, tumult, horror, o'er the throng</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The heroes sweat beneath their honour'd load:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when two mules, along the rugged road,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Within, without the trench, and all the way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Strow'd in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such horror Jove impress'd! yet still proceeds</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE GRIEF OF ACHILLES, AND NEW ARMOUR MADE HIM BY VULCAN.</p>

<p>The news of the death of Patroclus is brought to Achilles by
Antilochus. Thetis, hearing his lamentations, comes with all her sea-
nymphs to comfort him. The speeches of the mother and son on this
occasion. Iris appears to Achilles by the command of Juno, and orders
him to show himself at the head of the intrenchments. The sight of him
turns the fortunes of the day, and the body of Patroclus is carried off
by the Greeks. The Trojans call a council, where Hector and Polydamas
disagree in their opinions: but the advice of the former prevails, to
remain encamped in the field. The grief of Achilles over the body of
Patroclus.</p>

<p>Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son. The
description of the wonderful works of Vulcan: and, lastly, that noble
one of the shield of Achilles.</p>

<p>The latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day, and the night ensuing,
take up this book: the scene is at Achilles' tent on the sea-shore,
from whence it changes to the palace of Vulcan.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,<note place="foot"><p>This is connected with the earlier part of last book, the
regular narrative being interrupted by the message of Antilochus and
the lamentations of Achilles.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile, where Hellespont's broad waters flow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stood Nestor's son, the messenger of woe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There sat Achilles, shaded by his sails,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On hoisted yards extended to the gales;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pensive he sat; for all that fate design'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to his soul he said: "Ah! what constrains</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is this the day, which heaven so long ago</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ordain'd, to sink me with the weight of woe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(So Thetis warn'd;) when by a Trojan hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bravest of the Myrmidonian band</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should lose the light! Fulfilled is that decree;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fallen is the warrior, and Patroclus he!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain I charged him soon to quit the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And warn'd to shun Hectorean force in vain!"</l>
</lg>

<pb n="332" /><anchor id="Pg332" />

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus while he thinks, Antilochus appears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And tells the melancholy tale with tears.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Sad tidings, son of Peleus! thou must hear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wretched I, the unwilling messenger!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dead is Patroclus! For his corse they fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His naked corse: his arms are Hector's right."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sudden horror shot through all the chief,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wrapp'd his senses in the cloud of grief;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Cast on the ground, with furious hands he spread</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The scorching ashes o'er his graceful head;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His purple garments, and his golden hairs,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those he deforms with dust, and these he tears;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On the hard soil his groaning breast he threw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And roll'd and grovell'd, as to earth he grew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The virgin captives, with disorder'd charms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Won by his own, or by Patroclus' arms,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rush'd from their tents with cries; and gathering round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Nestor's son sustains a manlier part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And mourns the warrior with a warrior's heart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hangs on his arms, amidst his frantic woe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And oft prevents the meditated blow.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far in the deep abysses of the main,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Far in the deep.</hi> So Oceanus hears the lamentations of
Prometheus, in the play of Æschylus, and comes from the depths of the
sea to comfort him.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With hoary Nereus, and the watery train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mother-goddess from her crystal throne</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heard his loud cries, and answer'd groan for groan.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The circling Nereids with their mistress weep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all the sea-green sisters of the deep.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thalia, Glauce (every watery name),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nesaea mild, and silver Spio came:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Cymothoe and Cymodoce were nigh,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the blue languish of soft Alia's eye.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their locks Actaea and Limnoria rear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Proto, Doris, Panope appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thoa, Pherusa, Doto, Melita;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Agave gentle, and Amphithoe gay:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next Callianira, Callianassa show</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their sister looks; Dexamene the slow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And swift Dynamene, now cut the tides:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Iaera now the verdant wave divides:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nemertes with Apseudes lifts the head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bright Galatea quits her pearly bed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These Orythia, Clymene, attend,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Amatheia with her amber hair.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All these, and all that deep in ocean held</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their sacred seats, the glimmering grotto fill'd;</l>
<pb n="333" /><anchor id="Pg333" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each beat her ivory breast with silent woe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till Thetis' sorrows thus began to flow:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hear me, and judge, ye sisters of the main!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How just a cause has Thetis to complain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How wretched, were I mortal, were my fate!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How more than wretched in the immortal state!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from my bed a godlike hero came,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bravest far that ever bore the name;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like some fair olive, by my careful hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He grew, he flourish'd and adorn'd the land</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Troy I sent him: but the fates ordain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He never, never must return again.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So short a space the light of heaven to view,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So short, alas! and fill'd with anguish too!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hear how his sorrows echo through the shore!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I cannot ease them, but I must deplore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I go at least to bear a tender part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And mourn my loved-one with a mother's heart."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She said, and left the caverns of the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All bathed in tears; the melancholy train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Attend her way. Wide-opening part the tides,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the long pomp the silver wave divides.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Approaching now, they touch'd the Trojan land;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, two by two, ascended up the strand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The immortal mother, standing close beside</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her mournful offspring, to his sighs replied;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Along the coast their mingled clamours ran,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus the silver-footed dame began:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Why mourns my son? thy late preferr'd request</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god has granted, and the Greeks distress'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Why mourns my son? thy anguish let me share,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Reveal the cause, and trust a parent's care."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He, deeply groaning—"To this cureless grief,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not even the Thunderer's favour brings relief.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus—Ah!—say, goddess, can I boast</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A pleasure now? revenge itself is lost;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus, loved of all my martial train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beyond mankind, beyond myself is slain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lost are those arms the gods themselves bestow'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On Peleus; Hector bears the glorious load.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Cursed be that day, when all the powers above</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy charms submitted to a mortal love:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O hadst thou still, a sister of the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pursued the pleasures of the watery reign:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And happier Peleus, less ambitious, led</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A mortal beauty to his equal bed!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had caused such sorrows past, and woes to come.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For soon, alas! that wretched offspring slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">New woes, new sorrows, shall create again.</l>
<pb n="334" /><anchor id="Pg334" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis not in fate the alternate now to give;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus dead, Achilles hates to live.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let me revenge it on proud Hector's heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let his last spirit smoke upon my dart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On these conditions will I breathe: till then,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I blush to walk among the race of men."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A flood of tears, at this, the goddess shed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ah then, I see thee dying, see thee dead!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Hector falls, thou diest."—"Let Hector die,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And let me fall! (Achilles made reply)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far lies Patroclus from his native plain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He fell, and falling, wish'd my aid in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah then, since from this miserable day</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I cast all hope of my return away;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Since, unrevenged, a hundred ghosts demand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fate of Hector from Achilles' hand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Since here, for brutal courage far renown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I live an idle burden to the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Others in council famed for nobler skill,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">More useful to preserve, than I to kill,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let me—But oh! ye gracious powers above!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wrath and revenge from men and gods remove:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far, far too dear to every mortal breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sweet to the soul, as honey to the taste:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gathering like vapours of a noxious kind</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From fiery blood, and darkening all the mind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Me Agamemnon urged to deadly hate;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis past—I quell it; I resign to fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yes—I will meet the murderer of my friend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or (if the gods ordain it) meet my end.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stroke of fate the strongest cannot shun:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great Alcides, Jove's unequall'd son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Juno's hate, at length resign'd his breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sunk the victim of all-conquering death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So shall Achilles fall! stretch'd pale and dead,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more the Grecian hope, or Trojan dread!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let me, this instant, rush into the fields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And reap what glory life's short harvest yields.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall I not force some widow'd dame to tear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With frantic hands her long dishevell'd hair?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall I not force her breast to heave with sighs,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the soft tears to trickle from her eyes?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yes, I shall give the fair those mournful charms—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain you hold me—Hence! my arms! my arms!—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon shall the sanguine torrent spread so wide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That all shall know Achilles swells the tide."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"My son (coerulean Thetis made reply,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The immortal empress of the realms above;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unknown to him who sits remote on high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unknown to all the synod of the sky."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thou comest in vain (he cries, with fury warm'd);</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unwilling as I am, of force I stay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till Thetis bring me at the dawn of day</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vulcanian arms: what other can I wield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Except the mighty Telamonian shield?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That, in my friend's defence, has Ajax spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While his strong lance around him heaps the dead:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gallant chief defends Menoetius' son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And does what his Achilles should have done."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thy want of arms (said Iris) well we know;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But though unarm'd, yet clad in terrors, go!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let but Achilles o'er yon trench appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proud Troy shall tremble, and consent to fear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece from one glance of that tremendous eye</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around his brows a golden cloud she spread;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A stream of glory flamed above his head.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thick on the hills the flaming beacons blaze;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With long-projected beams the seas are bright,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heaven's high arch reflects the ruddy light:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So from Achilles' head the splendours rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Reflecting blaze on blaze against the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth march'd the chief, and distant from the crowd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on the rampart raised his voice aloud;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With her own shout Minerva swells the sound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy starts astonish'd, and the shores rebound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As the loud trumpet's brazen mouth from far</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With shrilling clangour sounds the alarm of war,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hosts dropp'd their arms, and trembled as they heard:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And back the chariots roll, and coursers bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And steeds and men lie mingled on the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Aghast they see the living lightnings play,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And turn their eyeballs from the flashing ray.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrice from the trench his dreadful voice he raised,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thrice they fled, confounded and amazed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Twelve in the tumult wedged, untimely rush'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On their own spears, by their own chariots crush'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While, shielded from the darts, the Greeks obtain</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sent refulgent to the field of war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Unhappy change!) now senseless, pale, he found,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far from Troy walls, and on a naked coast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I deem'd not Greece so dreadful, while engaged</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In mutual feuds her king and hero raged;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, while we hoped our armies might prevail</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">We boldly camp'd beside a thousand sail.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I dread Pelides now: his rage of mind</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not long continues to the shores confined,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Contending nations won and lost the day;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For Troy, for Troy, shall henceforth be the strife,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the hard contest not for fame, but life.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste then to Ilion, while the favouring night</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Detains these terrors, keeps that arm from fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If but the morrow's sun behold us here,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That arm, those terrors, we shall feel, not fear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hearts that now disdain, shall leap with joy,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whatever be our fate, yet let us try</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What force of thought and reason can supply;</l>

<pb n="339" /><anchor id="Pg339" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When morning dawns, our well-appointed powers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Array'd in arms, shall line the lofty towers.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let the fierce hero, then, when fury calls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vent his mad vengeance on our rocky walls,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nine years imprison'd in those towers ye lay?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wide o'er the world was Ilion famed of old</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Phrygians now her scatter'd spoils enjoy,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Darest thou dispirit whom the gods incite?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Flies any Trojan? I shall stop his flight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To better counsel then attention lend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Take due refreshment, and the watch attend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If there be one whose riches cost him care,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">If great Achilles rise in all his might,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lion thus, with dreadful anguish stung,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"In what vain promise, gods! did I engage,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and bade the sad attendants round</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">In its wide womb they pour the rushing stream;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The boiling water bubbles to the brim.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The body then they bathe with pious toil,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Embalm the wounds, anoint the limbs with oil,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on a bed of state extended laid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And decent cover'd with a linen shade;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Last o'er the dead the milk-white veil they threw;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile to Juno, in the realms above,</l>

compared this with the description of the shield of Hercules by Hesiod.
He remarks that, "with two or three exceptions, the imagery differs in
little more than the names and arrangements; and the difference of
arrangement in the Shield of Hercules is altogether for the worse. The
natural consecution of the Homeric images needs no exposition: it
constitutes in itself one of the beauties of the work. The Hesiodic
images are huddled together without connection or congruity: Mars
and Pallas are awkwardly introduced among the Centaurs and Lapithae;—
but the gap is wide indeed between them and Apollo with the Muses,
waking the echoes of Olympus to celestial harmonies; whence however, we
are hurried back to Perseus, the Gorgons, and other images of war, over
an arm of the sea, in which the sporting dolphins, the fugitive fishes,
and the fisherman on the shore with his casting net, are minutely
represented. As to the Hesiodic images themselves, the leading remark
is, that they catch at beauty by ornament, and at sublimity by
exaggeration; and upon the untenable supposition of the genuineness of
this poem, there is this curious peculiarity, that, in the description
of scenes of rustic peace, the superiority of Homer is decisive—while
in those of war and tumult it may be thought, perhaps, that the
Hesiodic poet has more than once the advantage."</p></note></l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.</p>

<p>Thetis brings to her son the armour made by Vulcan. She preserves the
body of his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the
army, to declare his resentment at an end. Agamemnon and Achilles are
solemnly reconciled: the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that
occasion. Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from
the battle till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of
Ulysses. The presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles, where
Briseis laments over the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately
refuses all repast, and gives himself up to lamentations for his
friend. Minerva descends to strengthen him, by the order of Jupiter. He
arms for the fight: his appearance described. He addresses himself to
his horses, and reproaches them with the death of Patroclus. One of
them is miraculously endued with voice, and inspired to prophesy his
fate: but the hero, not astonished by that prodigy, rushes with fury to
the combat.</p>

<p>The thirteenth day. The scene is on the sea-shore.</p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as Aurora heaved her Orient head</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their sovereign's sorrows in their own express'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A ray divine her heavenly presence shed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus, his hand soft touching, Thetis said:</l>

in the Grecian Mythology; it explains, according to the religious ideas
familiar to the old epic poets, both the distinguishing attributes and
the endless toil and endurances of Heracles, the most renowned
subjugator of all the semi-divine personages worshipped by the
Hellenes,—a being of irresistible force, and especially beloved by
Zeus, yet condemned constantly to labour for others and to
obey the commands of a worthless and cowardly persecutor. His
recompense is reserved to the close of his career, when his afflicting
trials are brought to a close: he is then admitted to the godhead, and
receives in marriage Hebe."—Grote, vol. i. p. 128.</p></note></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The solemn words a deep attention draw,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The first loved consort of my virgin bed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before these eyes in fatal battle bled:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My three brave brothers in one mournful day</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All trod the dark, irremeable way:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy friendly hand uprear'd me from the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dried my sorrows for a husband slain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles' care you promised I should prove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The first, the dearest partner of his love;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That rites divine should ratify the band,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And make me empress in his native land.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Accept these grateful tears! for thee they flow,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her sister captives echoed groan for groan,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The leaders press'd the chief on every side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unmoved he heard them, and with sighs denied.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"If yet Achilles have a friend, whose care</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and from the warriors turn'd his face:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet still the brother-kings of Atreus' race,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nestor, Idomeneus, Ulysses sage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Phoenix, strive to calm his grief and rage:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His rage they calm not, nor his grief control;</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thou too, Patroclus! (thus his heart he vents)</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">If yet that offspring lives; (I distant far,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">I could not this, this cruel stroke attend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fate claim'd Achilles, but might spare his friend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I hoped Patroclus might survive, to rear</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lofty palace, and the large domain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For Peleus breathes no more the vital air;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or drags a wretched life of age and care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But till the news of my sad fate invades</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His hastening soul, and sinks him to the shades."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sighing he said: his grief the heroes join'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each stole a tear for what he left behind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their mingled grief the sire of heaven survey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus with pity to his blue-eyed maid:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Is then Achilles now no more thy care,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo, where yon sails their canvas wings extend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All comfortless he sits, and wails his friend:</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke; and sudden, at the word of Jove,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wide air floating to her ample wings,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now issued from the ships the warrior-train,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full in the midst, high-towering o'er the rest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His limbs in arms divine Achilles dress'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arms which the father of the fire bestow'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forged on the eternal anvils of the god.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Grief and revenge his furious heart inspire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His glowing eyeballs roll with living fire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He grinds his teeth, and furious with delay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The silver cuishes first his thighs infold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then o'er his breast was braced the hollow gold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brazen sword a various baldric tied,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That, starr'd with gems, hung glittering at his side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Blazed with long rays, and gleam'd athwart the field.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wide o'er the watery waste, a light appears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which on the far-seen mountain blazing high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud howls the storm, and drives them o'er the main.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next, his high head the helmet graced; behind</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like the red star, that from his flaming hair</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So stream'd the golden honours from his head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Trembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief beholds himself with wondering eyes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His arms he poises, and his motions tries;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Buoy'd by some inward force, he seems to swim,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And feels a pinion lifting every limb.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now he shakes his great paternal spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ponderous and huge, which not a Greek could rear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Pelion's cloudy top an ash entire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Old Chiron fell'd, and shaped it for his sire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A spear which stern Achilles only wields,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Automedon and Alcimus prepare</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Waved o'er their backs, and to the chariot join'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The charioteer then whirl'd the lash around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And swift ascended at one active bound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All bright in heavenly arms, above his squire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not brighter Phoebus in the ethereal way</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Flames from his chariot, and restores the day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High o'er the host, all terrible he stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thunders to his steeds these dread commands:</l>
</lg>

<pb n="359" /><anchor id="Pg359" />

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Xanthus and Balius! of Podarges' strain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be swift, be mindful of the load ye bear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And learn to make your master more your care:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor, as ye left Patroclus, leave your lord."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The generous Xanthus, as the words he said,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seem'd sensible of woe, and droop'd his head:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Trembling he stood before the golden wain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bow'd to dust the honours of his mane.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When, strange to tell! (so Juno will'd) he broke</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eternal silence, and portentous spoke.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Achilles! yes! this day at least we bear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy rage in safety through the files of war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But come it will, the fatal time must come,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not ours the fault, but God decrees thy doom.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not through our crime, or slowness in the course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fell thy Patroclus, but by heavenly force;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bright far-shooting god who gilds the day</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Confess'd we saw him) tore his arms way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No—could our swiftness o'er the winds prevail,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or beat the pinions of the western gale,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All were in vain—the Fates thy death demand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Due to a mortal and immortal hand."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then ceased for ever, by the Furies tied,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fateful voice. The intrepid chief replied</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With unabated rage—"So let it be!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Portents and prodigies are lost on me.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I know my fate: to die, to see no more</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My much-loved parents, and my native shore—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Enough—when heaven ordains, I sink in night:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now perish Troy!" He said, and rush'd to fight.</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE BATTLE OF THE GODS, AND THE ACTS OF ACHILLES.</p>

<p>Jupiter, upon Achilles' return to the battle, calls a council of the
gods, and permits them to assist either party. The terrors of the
combat described, when the deities are engaged. Apollo encourages
Æneas to meet Achilles. After a long conversation, these two heroes
encounter; but Æneas is preserved by the assistance of Neptune.
Achilles falls upon the rest of the Trojans, and is upon the point of
killing Hector, but Apollo conveys him away in a cloud. Achilles
pursues the Trojans with a great slaughter.</p>

<p>The same day continues. The scene is in the field before Troy.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus round Pelides breathing war and blood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece, sheathed in arms, beside her vessels stood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While near impending from a neighbouring height,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy's black battalions wait the shock of fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Jove to Themis gives command, to call</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gods to council in the starry hall:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift o'er Olympus' hundred hills she flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And summons all the senate of the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These shining on, in long procession come</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Jove's eternal adamantine dome.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not one was absent, not a rural power</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That haunts the verdant gloom, or rosy bower;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each fair-hair'd dryad of the shady wood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each azure sister of the silver flood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All but old Ocean, hoary sire! who keeps</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On marble thrones, with lucid columns crown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The work of Vulcan,) sat the powers around.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even he whose trident sways the watery reign</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heard the loud summons, and forsook the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Assumed his throne amid the bright abodes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And question'd thus the sire of men and gods:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What moves the god who heaven and earth commands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And grasps the thunder in his awful hands,</l>
<pb n="361" /><anchor id="Pg361" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to convene the whole ethereal state?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is Greece and Troy the subject in debate?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already met, the louring hosts appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And death stands ardent on the edge of war."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"'Tis true (the cloud-compelling power replies)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This day we call the council of the skies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In care of human race; even Jove's own eye</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sees with regret unhappy mortals die.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far on Olympus' top in secret state</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ourself will sit, and see the hand of fate</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Work out our will. Celestial powers! descend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And as your minds direct, your succour lend</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To either host. Troy soon must lie o'erthrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If uncontroll'd Achilles fights alone:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What can they now, if in his rage he rise?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Assist them, gods! or Ilion's sacred wall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">May fall this day, though fate forbids the fall."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and fired their heavenly breasts with rage.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On adverse parts the warring gods engage:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaven's awful queen; and he whose azure round</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Girds the vast globe; the maid in arms renown'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hermes, of profitable arts the sire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Vulcan, the black sovereign of the fire:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These to the fleet repair with instant flight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The vessels tremble as the gods alight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In aid of Troy, Latona, Phoebus came,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mars fiery-helm'd, the laughter-loving dame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Xanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the chaste huntress of the silver bow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ere yet the gods their various aid employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each Argive bosom swell'd with manly joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While great Achilles (terror of the plain),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long lost to battle, shone in arms again.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dreadful he stood in front of all his host;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pale Troy beheld, and seem'd already lost;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her bravest heroes pant with inward fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And trembling see another god of war.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when the powers descending swell'd the fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affright</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Varied each face: then Discord sounds alarms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Earth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now through the trembling shores Minerva calls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now she thunders from the Grecian walls.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mars hovering o'er his Troy, his terror shrouds</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now through each Trojan heart he fury pours</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With voice divine, from Ilion's topmost towers:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now shouts to Simois, from her beauteous hill;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Apollo wedged him in the warrior's way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But swell'd his bosom with undaunted might,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Half-forced and half-persuaded to the fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like young Lycaon, of the royal line,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In voice and aspect, seem'd the power divine;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bade the chief reflect, how late with scorn</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In distant threats he braved the goddess-born.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus the hero of Anchises' strain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"To meet Pelides you persuade in vain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already have I met, nor void of fear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Observed the fury of his flying spear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Ida's woods he chased us to the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our force he scattered, and our herds he kill'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lyrnessus, Pedasus in ashes lay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But (Jove assisting) I survived the day:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Else had I sunk oppress'd in fatal fight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By fierce Achilles and Minerva's might.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where'er he moved, the goddess shone before,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What mortal man Achilles can sustain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The immortals guard him through the dreadful plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And suffer not his dart to fall in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Were God my aid, this arm should check his power,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though strong in battle as a brazen tower."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the son of Jove: "That god implore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And be what great Achilles was before.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From heavenly Venus thou deriv'st thy strain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And he but from a sister of the main;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then lift thy weapon for a noble blow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, and spirit breathed into his breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the thick troops the embolden'd hero press'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His venturous act the white-arm'd queen survey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus, assembling all the powers, she said:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Restrain his bold career; at least, to attend</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our favour'd hero, let some power descend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guard his life, and add to his renown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">We, the great armament of heaven, came down.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hereafter let him fall, as Fates design,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That spun so short his life's illustrious line:<note place="foot"><p>These words seem to imply the old belief, that the Fates
might be delayed, but never wholly set aside.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But lest some adverse god now cross his way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Give him to know what powers assist this day:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For how shall mortal stand the dire alarms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When heaven's refulgent host appear in arms?"<note place="foot"><p>It was anciently believed that it was dangerous, if not
fatal, to behold a deity. See Exod. xxxiii. 20; Judg. xiii. 22.</p></note></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus she; and thus the god whose force can make</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The solid globe's eternal basis shake:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Against the might of man, so feeble known,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Why should celestial powers exert their own?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Suffice from yonder mount to view the scene,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And leave to war the fates of mortal men.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But if the armipotent, or god of light,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Obstruct Achilles, or commence the fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thence on the gods of Troy we swift descend:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full soon, I doubt not, shall the conflict end;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And these, in ruin and confusion hurl'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yield to our conquering arms the lower world."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus having said, the tyrant of the sea,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Coerulean Neptune, rose, and led the way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Advanced upon the field there stood a mound</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">In elder times to guard Alcides made,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">What time a vengeful monster of the main</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swept the wide shore, and drove him to the plain.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here Neptune and the gods of Greece repair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With clouds encompass'd, and a veil of air:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Crown the fair hills that silver Simois shade.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In circle close each heavenly party sat,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The trampled centre yields a hollow sound:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gleaming champaign glows with brazen light.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amid both hosts (a dreadful space) appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There great Achilles; bold Æneas, here.</l>
<pb n="365" /><anchor id="Pg365" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With towering strides Aeneas first advanced;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The nodding plumage on his helmet danced:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spread o'er his breast the fencing shield he bore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, so he moved, his javelin flamed before.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so Pelides; furious to engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He rush'd impetuous. Such the lion's rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though all in arms the peopled city rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stalks careless on, with unregarding pride;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till at the length, by some brave youth defied,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To his bold spear the savage turns alone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He murmurs fury with a hollow groan;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lash'd by his tail his heaving sides resound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Resolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So fierce Achilles on Æneas flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So stands Æneas, and his force defies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ere yet the stern encounter join'd, begun</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The seed of Thetis thus to Venus' son:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Why comes Æneas through the ranks so far?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seeks he to meet Achilles' arm in war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In hope the realms of Priam to enjoy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And prove his merits to the throne of Troy?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Grant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The partial monarch may refuse the prize;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sons he has many; those thy pride may quell:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And 'tis his fault to love those sons too well,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or, in reward of thy victorious hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Has Troy proposed some spacious tract of land</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">An ample forest, or a fair domain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of hills for vines, and arable for grain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But can Achilles be so soon forgot?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Once (as I think) you saw this brandish'd spear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And then the great Æneas seem'd to fear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With hearty haste from Ida's mount he fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor, till he reach'd Lyrnessus, turn'd his head.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her lofty walls not long our progress stay'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In Grecian chains her captive race were cast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis true, the great Aeneas fled too fast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Defrauded of my conquest once before,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What then I lost, the gods this day restore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go; while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where the shrill brass return'd a sharper sound:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then from Achilles chased the mist away:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sudden, returning with a stream of light,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The scene of war came rushing on his sight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus, amazed; "What wonders strike my mind!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My spear, that parted on the wings of wind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Laid here before me! and the Dardan lord,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That fell this instant, vanish'd from my sword!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I thought alone with mortals to contend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But powers celestial sure this foe defend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great as he is, our arms he scarce will try,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Content for once, with all his gods, to fly.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now then let others bleed." This said, aloud</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He vents his fury and inflames the crowd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O Greeks! (he cries, and every rank alarms)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Join battle, man to man, and arms to arms!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis not in me, though favour'd by the sky,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No god can singly such a host engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not Mars himself, nor great Minerva's rage.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But whatsoe'er Achilles can inspire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whate'er of active force, or acting fire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whate'er this heart can prompt, or hand obey;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All, all Achilles, Greeks! is yours to-day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thin the squadrons with my single spear."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: nor less elate with martial joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The godlike Hector warm'd the troops of Troy:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Trojans, to war! Think, Hector leads you on;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor dread the vaunts of Peleus' haughty son.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deeds must decide our fate. E'en these with words</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Insult the brave, who tremble at their swords:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not though his heart were steel, his hands were fire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That fire, that steel, your Hector should withstand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And brave that vengeful heart, that dreadful hand."</l>
</lg>

<pb n="370" /><anchor id="Pg370" />

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus (breathing rage through all) the hero said;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A wood of lances rises round his head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Clamours on clamours tempest all the air,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They join, they throng, they thicken to the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Phoebus warns him from high heaven to shun</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The single fight with Thetis' godlike son;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">More safe to combat in the mingled band,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He hears, obedient to the god of light,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, plunged within the ranks, awaits the fight.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then fierce Achilles, shouting to the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On Troy's whole force with boundless fury flies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First falls Iphytion, at his army's head;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Brave was the chief, and brave the host he led;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From great Otrynteus he derived his blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His mother was a Nais, of the flood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath the shades of Tmolus, crown'd with snow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Hyde's walls he ruled the lands below.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce as he springs, the sword his head divides:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The parted visage falls on equal sides:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With loud-resounding arms he strikes the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thus Achilles glories o'er the slain:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Lie there, Otryntides! the Trojan earth</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Receives thee dead, though Gygae boast thy birth;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those beauteous fields where Hyllus' waves are roll'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And plenteous Hermus swells with tides of gold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Are thine no more."—The insulting hero said,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And left him sleeping in eternal shade.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rolling wheels of Greece the body tore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dash'd their axles with no vulgar gore.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Demoleon next, Antenor's offspring, laid</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Breathless in dust, the price of rashness paid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The impatient steel with full-descending sway</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forced through his brazen helm its furious way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Resistless drove the batter'd skull before,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dash'd and mingled all the brains with gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This sees Hippodamas, and seized with fright,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deserts his chariot for a swifter flight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lance arrests him: an ignoble wound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The panting Trojan rivets to the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He groans away his soul: not louder roars,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At Neptune's shrine on Helice's high shores,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The victim bull; the rocks re-bellow round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And ocean listens to the grateful sound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then fell on Polydore his vengeful rage,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">On Polydore.</hi> Euripides, Virgil, and others, relate
that Polydore was sent into Thrace, to the house of Polymestor, for
protection, being the youngest of Priam's sons, and that he was
treacherously murdered by his host for the sake of the treasure sent
with him.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youngest hope of Priam's stooping age:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Whose feet for swiftness in the race surpass'd:)</l>
<pb n="371" /><anchor id="Pg371" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of all his sons, the dearest, and the last.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the forbidden field he takes his flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In the first folly of a youthful knight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But vaunts not long, with all his swiftness slain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck where the crossing belts unite behind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And golden rings the double back-plate join'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rushing entrails pour'd upon the ground</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His hands collect; and darkness wraps him round.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Hector view'd, all ghastly in his gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus sadly slain the unhappy Polydore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A cloud of sorrow overcast his sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His soul no longer brook'd the distant fight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full in Achilles' dreadful front he came,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And shook his javelin like a waving flame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Peleus sees, with joy possess'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His heart high-bounding in his rising breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"And, lo! the man on whom black fates attend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The man, that slew Achilles, is his friend!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more shall Hector's and Pelides' spear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Turn from each other in the walks of war."—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then with revengeful eyes he scann'd him o'er:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Come, and receive thy fate!" He spake no more.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector, undaunted, thus: "Such words employ</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To one that dreads thee, some unwarlike boy:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such we could give, defying and defied,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mean intercourse of obloquy and pride!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I know thy force to mine superior far;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But heaven alone confers success in war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mean as I am, the gods may guide my dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And give it entrance in a braver heart."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then parts the lance: but Pallas' heavenly breath</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far from Achilles wafts the winged death:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bidden dart again to Hector flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And at the feet of its great master lies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles closes with his hated foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But present to his aid, Apollo shrouds</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The favour'd hero in a veil of clouds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrice struck Pelides with indignant heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spear a fourth time buried in the cloud.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He foams with fury, and exclaims aloud:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Wretch! thou hast 'scaped again; once more thy flight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Has saved thee, and the partial god of light.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If any power assist Achilles' hand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fly then inglorious! but thy flight this day</l>
<pb n="372" /><anchor id="Pg372" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With that, he gluts his rage on numbers slain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced through the neck: he left him panting there,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stopp'd Demuchus, great Philetor's heir.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gigantic chief! deep gash'd the enormous blade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And for the soul an ample passage made.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Laoganus and Dardanus expire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The valiant sons of an unhappy sire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Both in one instant from the chariot hurl'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sunk in one instant to the nether world:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This difference only their sad fates afford</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That one the spear destroy'd, and one the sword.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor less unpitied, young Alastor bleeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain his youth, in vain his beauty pleads;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain he begs thee, with a suppliant's moan,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To spare a form, an age so like thy own!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unhappy boy! no prayer, no moving art,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">E'er bent that fierce, inexorable heart!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While yet he trembled at his knees, and cried,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ruthless falchion oped his tender side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The panting liver pours a flood of gore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That drowns his bosom till he pants no more.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through Mulius' head then drove the impetuous spear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior falls, transfix'd from ear to ear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy life, Echeclus! next the sword bereaves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Warm'd in the brain the smoking weapon lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The purple death comes floating o'er his eyes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then brave Deucalion died: the dart was flung</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He dropp'd his arm, an unassisting weight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stood all impotent, expecting fate:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on his neck the falling falchion sped,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his broad shoulders hew'd his crested head:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, sunk in dust, the corpse extended lies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rhigmas, whose race from fruitful Thracia came,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The son of Pierus, an illustrious name,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Succeeds to fate: the spear his belly rends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone from his car the thundering chief descends.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The squire, who saw expiring on the ground</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His prostrate master, rein'd the steeds around;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His back, scarce turn'd, the Pelian javelin gored,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stretch'd the servant o'er his dying lord.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when a flame the winding valley fills,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And runs on crackling shrubs between the hills;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then o'er the stubble up the mountain flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fires the high woods, and blazes to the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This way and that, the spreading torrent roars:</l>
<pb n="373" /><anchor id="Pg373" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So sweeps the hero through the wasted shores;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around him wide, immense destruction pours</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And earth is deluged with the sanguine showers</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As with autumnal harvests cover'd o'er,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thick bestrewn, lies Ceres' sacred floor;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When round and round, with never-wearied pain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The trampling steers beat out the unnumber'd grain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes' souls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dash'd from their hoofs while o'er the dead they fly,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Black, bloody drops the smoking chariot dye:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thick the groaning axles dropp'd with gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High o'er the scene of death Achilles stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All grim with dust, all horrible in blood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet still insatiate, still with rage on flame;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such is the lust of never-dying fame!</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.<note place="foot"><p>"Perhaps the boldest
excursion of Homer into this region of poetical fancy is the collision
into which, in the twenty-first of the Iliad, he has brought the river
god Scamander, first with Achilles, and afterwards with Vulcan, when
summoned by Juno to the hero's aid. The overwhelming fury of the stream
finds the natural interpretation in the character of the mountain
torrents of Greece and Asia Minor. Their wide, shingly beds are in
summer comparatively dry, so as to be easily forded by the foot
passenger. But a thunder-shower in the mountains, unobserved perhaps by
the traveller on the plain, may suddenly immerse him in the flood of a
mighty river. The rescue of Achilles by the fiery arms of Vulcan
scarcely admits of the same ready explanation from physical causes. Yet
the subsiding of the flood at the critical moment when the hero's
destruction appeared imminent, might, by a slight extension of the
figurative parallel, be ascribed to a god symbolic of the influences
opposed to all atmospheric moisture."—Mure, vol. i. p. 480, sq.</p></note></p>

<p>The Trojans fly before Achilles, some towards the town, others to the
river Scamander: he falls upon the latter with great slaughter: takes
twelve captives alive, to sacrifice to the shade of Patroclus; and
kills Lycaon and Asteropeus. Scamander attacks him with all his waves:
Neptune and Pallas assist the hero: Simois joins Scamander: at length
Vulcan, by the instigation of Juno, almost dries up the river. This
Combat ended, the other gods engage each other. Meanwhile Achilles
continues the slaughter, drives the rest into Troy: Agenor only makes a
stand, and is conveyed away in a cloud by Apollo; who (to delude
Achilles) takes upon him Agenor's shape, and while he pursues him in
that disguise, gives the Trojans an opportunity of retiring into their
city.</p>

<p>The same day continues. The scene is on the banks and in the stream of
Scamander.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now to Xanthus' gliding stream they drove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The river here divides the flying train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Part to the town fly diverse o'er the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now chased, and trembling in ignoble flight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Part plunge into the stream: old Xanthus roars,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flashing billows beat the whiten'd shores:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With cries promiscuous all the banks resound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And here, and there, in eddies whirling round,</l>
<pb n="375" /><anchor id="Pg375" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As the scorch'd locusts from their fields retire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Driven from the land before the smoky cloud,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The clustering legions rush into the flood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles' force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His bloody lance the hero casts aside,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arm'd with his sword, high brandish'd o'er the waves:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep groan'd the waters with the dying sound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the warm purple circled on the tide.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And close in rocks or winding caverns lie:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So the huge dolphin tempesting the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In shoals before him fly the scaly train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confusedly heap'd they seek their inmost caves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now, tired with slaughter, from the Trojan band</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With their rich belts their captive arms restrains</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains).</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These his attendants to the ships convey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sad victims destined to Patroclus' shade;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, as once more he plunged amid the flood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The young Lycaon in his passage stood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Priam; whom the hero's hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But late made captive in his father's land</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(As from a sycamore, his sounding steel</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lopp'd the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Lemnos' isle he sold the royal slave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where Jason's son the price demanded gave;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But kind Eetion, touching on the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ransom'd prince to fair Arisbe bore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ten days were past, since in his father's reign</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He felt the sweets of liberty again;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The next, that god whom men in vain withstand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gives the same youth to the same conquering hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now never to return! and doom'd to go</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sadder journey to the shades below.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His well-known face when great Achilles eyed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The helm and visor he had cast aside</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With wild affright, and dropp'd upon the field</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His useless lance and unavailing shield,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As trembling, panting, from the stream he fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And knock'd his faltering knees, the hero said.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye mighty gods! what wonders strike my view!</l>
<pb n="376" /><anchor id="Pg376" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sure I shall see yon heaps of Trojans kill'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rise from the shades, and brave me on the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As now the captive, whom so late I bound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sold to Lemnos, stalks on Trojan ground!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not him the sea's unmeasured deeps detain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That bar such numbers from their native plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! he returns. Try, then, my flying spear!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Try, if the grave can hold the wanderer;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If earth, at length this active prince can seize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Earth, whose strong grasp has held down Hercules."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus while he spoke, the Trojan pale with fears</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Approach'd, and sought his knees with suppliant tears</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loth as he was to yield his youthful breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his soul shivering at the approach of death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles raised the spear, prepared to wound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He kiss'd his feet, extended on the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And while, above, the spear suspended stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One hand embraced them close, one stopp'd the dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thus these melting words attempt his heart:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thy well-known captive, great Achilles! see,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Once more Lycaon trembles at thy knee.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some pity to a suppliant's name afford,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who shared the gifts of Ceres at thy board;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom late thy conquering arm to Lemnos bore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far from his father, friends, and native shore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A hundred oxen were his price that day,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now sums immense thy mercy shall repay.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce respited from woes I yet appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! Jove again submits me to thy hands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Again, her victim cruel Fate demands!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I sprang from Priam, and Laothoe fair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Old Altes' daughter, and Lelegia's heir;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who held in Pedasus his famed abode,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And ruled the fields where silver Satnio flow'd,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two sons (alas! unhappy sons) she bore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For ah! one spear shall drink each brother's gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And I succeed to slaughter'd Polydore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How from that arm of terror shall I fly?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some demon urges! 'tis my doom to die!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If ever yet soft pity touch'd thy mind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah! think not me too much of Hector's kind!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With his, who wrought thy loved Patroclus' death."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These words, attended with a shower of tears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youth address'd to unrelenting ears:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Talk not of life, or ransom (he replies):</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus dead, whoever meets me, dies:</l>
<pb n="377" /><anchor id="Pg377" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain a single Trojan sues for grace;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But least, the sons of Priam's hateful race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Die then, my friend! what boots it to deplore?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great, the good Patroclus is no more!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He, far thy better, was foredoom'd to die,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thou, dost thou bewail mortality?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seest thou not me, whom nature's gifts adorn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from a hero, from a goddess born?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The day shall come (which nothing can avert)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When by the spear, the arrow, or the dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By night, or day, by force, or by design,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Impending death and certain fate are mine!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Die then,"—He said; and as the word he spoke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fainting stripling sank before the stroke:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His hand forgot its grasp, and left the spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While all his trembling frame confess'd his fear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sudden, Achilles his broad sword display'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And buried in his neck the reeking blade.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone fell the youth; and panting on the land,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The victor to the stream the carcase gave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus insults him, floating on the wave:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Lie there, Lycaon! let the fish surround</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy bloated corpse, and suck thy gory wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There no sad mother shall thy funerals weep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But swift Scamander roll thee to the deep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose every wave some watery monster brings,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To feast unpunish'd on the fat of kings.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So perish Troy, and all the Trojan line!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such ruin theirs, and such compassion mine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What boots ye now Scamander's worshipp'd stream,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His earthly honours, and immortal name?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain your immolated bulls are slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your living coursers glut his gulfs in vain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus he rewards you, with this bitter fate;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus, till the Grecian vengeance is complete:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus is atoned Patroclus' honour'd shade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the short absence of Achilles paid."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These boastful words provoked the raging god;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With fury swells the violated flood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What means divine may yet the power employ</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To check Achilles, and to rescue Troy?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile the hero springs in arms, to dare</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great Asteropeus to mortal war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Pelagon, whose lofty line</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Flows from the source of Axius, stream divine!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Fair Peribaea's love the god had crown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With all his refluent waters circled round:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On him Achilles rush'd; he fearless stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And shook two spears, advancing from the flood;</l>
<pb n="378" /><anchor id="Pg378" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flood impell'd him, on Pelides' head</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Near as they drew, Achilles thus began:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What art thou, boldest of the race of man?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who, or from whence? Unhappy is the sire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose son encounters our resistless ire."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O son of Peleus! what avails to trace</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Replied the warrior) our illustrious race?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From rich Paeonia's valleys I command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arm'd with protended spears, my native band;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now shines the tenth bright morning since I came</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In aid of Ilion to the fields of fame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Axius, who swells with all the neighbouring rills,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wide around the floated region fills,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Begot my sire, whose spear much glory won:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now lift thy arm, and try that hero's son!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Threatening he said: the hostile chiefs advance;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once Asteropeus discharged each lance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(For both his dexterous hands the lance could wield,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One struck, but pierced not, the Vulcanian shield;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One razed Achilles' hand; the spouting blood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spun forth; in earth the fasten'd weapon stood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like lightning next the Pelean javelin flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Its erring fury hiss'd along the skies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even to the middle earth; and quiver'd there.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then from his side the sword Pelides drew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And on his foe with double fury flew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The foe thrice tugg'd, and shook the rooted wood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Repulsive of his might the weapon stood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fourth, he tries to break the spear in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bent as he stands, he tumbles to the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His belly open'd with a ghastly wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The reeking entrails pour upon the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath the hero's feet he panting lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his eye darkens, and his spirit flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the proud victor thus triumphing said,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His radiant armour tearing from the dead:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"So ends thy glory! Such the fate they prove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who strive presumptuous with the sons of Jove!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from a river, didst thou boast thy line?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But great Saturnius is the source of mine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of Peleus, Æacus, and Jove, am I.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The race of these superior far to those,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As he that thunders to the stream that flows.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What rivers can, Scamander might have shown;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Jove he dreads, nor wars against his son.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even Achelous might contend in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all the roaring billows of the main.</l>
<pb n="379" /><anchor id="Pg379" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The eternal ocean, from whose fountains flow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The seas, the rivers, and the springs below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The thundering voice of Jove abhors to hear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in his deep abysses shakes with fear."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: then from the bank his javelin tore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And left the breathless warrior in his gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The floating tides the bloody carcase lave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And beat against it, wave succeeding wave;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till, roll'd between the banks, it lies the food</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of curling eels, and fishes of the flood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All scatter'd round the stream (their mightiest slain)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The amazed Paeonians scour along the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He vents his fury on the flying crew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrasius, Astyplus, and Mnesus slew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mydon, Thersilochus, with Ænius, fell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And numbers more his lance had plunged to hell,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But from the bottom of his gulfs profound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scamander spoke; the shores return'd the sound.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O first of mortals! (for the gods are thine)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In valour matchless, and in force divine!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If Jove have given thee every Trojan head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">See! my choked streams no more their course can keep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Turn then, impetuous! from our injured flood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Content, thy slaughters could amaze a god."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In human form, confess'd before his eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The river thus; and thus the chief replies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O sacred stream! thy word we shall obey;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But not till Troy the destined vengeance pay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not till within her towers the perjured train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall pant, and tremble at our arms again;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not till proud Hector, guardian of her wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or stain this lance, or see Achilles fall."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said; and drove with fury on the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then to the godhead of the silver bow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The yellow flood began: "O son of Jove!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Was not the mandate of the sire above</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full and express, that Phoebus should employ</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His sacred arrows in defence of Troy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And make her conquer, till Hyperion's fall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In awful darkness hide the face of all?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke in vain—The chief without dismay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rising in his rage above the shores,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From all his deep the bellowing river roars,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And round the banks the ghastly dead are toss'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While all before, the billows ranged on high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(A watery bulwark,) screen the bands who fly.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now bursting on his head with thundering sound,</l>
<pb n="380" /><anchor id="Pg380" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The falling deluge whelms the hero round:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His loaded shield bends to the rushing tide;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sliddering, and staggering. On the border stood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A spreading elm, that overhung the flood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The plant uprooted to his weight gave way.<note place="foot"><p>Wood has observed, that "the circumstance of a falling tree,
which is described as reaching from one of its banks to the other,
affords a very just idea of the breadth of the Scamander."</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaving the bank, and undermining all;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud flash the waters to the rushing fall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of the thick foliage. The large trunk display'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bridged the rough flood across: the hero stay'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On this his weight, and raised upon his hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Leap'd from the channel, and regain'd the land.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then blacken'd the wild waves: the murmur rose:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god pursues, a huger billow throws,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The man whose fury is the fate of Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He like the warlike eagle speeds his pace</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race);</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far as a spear can fly, Achilles springs;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At every bound his clanging armour rings:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now here, now there, he turns on every side,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And winds his course before the following tide;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The waves flow after, wheresoe'er he wheels,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gather fast, and murmur at his heels.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So when a peasant to his garden brings</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soft rills of water from the bubbling springs,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as he clears whate'er their passage stay'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And marks the future current with his spade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift o'er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Louder and louder purl the falling rills;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before him scattering, they prevent his pains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And shine in mazy wanderings o'er the plains.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still flies Achilles, but before his eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still swift Scamander rolls where'er he flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not all his speed escapes the rapid floods;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The first of men, but not a match for gods.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oft as he turn'd the torrent to oppose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bravely try if all the powers were foes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beats on his back, or bursts upon his head.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And still indignant bounds above the waves.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tired by the tides, his knees relax with toil;</l>
<pb n="381" /><anchor id="Pg381" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wash'd from beneath him slides the slimy soil;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When thus (his eyes on heaven's expansion thrown)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth bursts the hero with an angry groan:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Is there no god Achilles to befriend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No power to avert his miserable end?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prevent, O Jove! this ignominious date,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Ignominious.</hi> Drowning, as compared with a death in
the field of battle, was considered utterly disgraceful.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And make my future life the sport of fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of all heaven's oracles believed in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But most of Thetis must her son complain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Phoebus' darts she prophesied my fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In glorious arms before the Trojan wall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh! had I died in fields of battle warm,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd like a hero, by a hero's arm!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Might Hector's spear this dauntless bosom rend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And my swift soul o'ertake my slaughter'd friend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah no! Achilles meets a shameful fate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh how unworthy of the brave and great!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Crossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">An unregarded carcase to the sea."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Neptune and Pallas haste to his relief,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus in human form address'd the chief:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The power of ocean first: "Forbear thy fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O son of Peleus! Lo, thy gods appear!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold! from Jove descending to thy aid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Propitious Neptune, and the blue-eyed maid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till Troy receive her flying sons, till all</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her routed squadrons pant behind their wall:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector alone shall stand his fatal chance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Hector's blood shall smoke upon thy lance.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thine is the glory doom'd." Thus spake the gods:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then swift ascended to the bright abodes.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He springs impetuous, and invades the field:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er all the expanded plain the waters spread;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Floating 'midst scatter'd arms; while casques of gold</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And turn'd-up bucklers glitter'd as they roll'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High o'er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not a whole river stops the hero's course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Pallas fills him with immortal force.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With equal rage, indignant Xanthus roars,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lifts his billows, and o'erwhelms his shores.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus to Simois! "Haste, my brother flood;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Increased with gore, and swelling with the slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, murmuring from his beds, he boils, he raves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And a foam whitens on the purple waves:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At every step, before Achilles stood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The crimson surge, and deluged him with blood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fear touch'd the queen of heaven: she saw dismay'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She call'd aloud, and summon'd Vulcan's aid.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Rise to the war! the insulting flood requires</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy wasteful arm! assemble all thy fires!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While to their aid, by our command enjoin'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rush the swift eastern and the western wind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These from old ocean at my word shall blow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pour the red torrent on the watery foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Corses and arms to one bright ruin turn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hissing rivers to their bottoms burn.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go, mighty in thy rage! display thy power,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drink the whole flood, the crackling trees devour.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scorch all the banks! and (till our voice reclaim)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Exert the unwearied furies of the flame!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The power ignipotent her word obeys:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wide o'er the plain he pours the boundless blaze;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once consumes the dead, and dries the soil</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the shrunk waters in their channel boil.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when autumnal Boreas sweeps the sky,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And instant blows the water'd gardens dry:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So look'd the field, so whiten'd was the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Vulcan breathed the fiery blast around.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Along the margin winds the running blaze:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The trees in flaming rows to ashes turn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Broad elm, and cypress rising in a spire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The watery willows hiss before the fire.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now glow the waves, the fishes pant for breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The eels lie twisting in the pangs of death:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now flounce aloft, now dive the scaly fry,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or, gasping, turn their bellies to the sky.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At length the river rear'd his languid head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus, short-panting, to the god he said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Oh Vulcan! oh! what power resists thy might?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I faint, I sink, unequal to the fight—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I yield—Let Ilion fall; if fate decree—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah—bend no more thy fiery arms on me!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ceased; wide conflagration blazing round;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bubbling waters yield a hissing sound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when the flames beneath a cauldron rise,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Beneath a caldron.</hi></p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"So, when with crackling flames a caldron fries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bubbling waters from the bottom rise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Above the brims they force their fiery way;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To melt the fat of some rich sacrifice,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amid the fierce embrace of circling fires</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The waters foam, the heavy smoke aspires:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So boils the imprison'd flood, forbid to flow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And choked with vapours feels his bottom glow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Juno then, imperial queen of air,</l>
<pb n="384" /><anchor id="Pg384" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The burning river sends his earnest prayer:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ah why, Saturnia; must thy son engage</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Me, only me, with all his wasteful rage?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On other gods his dreadful arm employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For mightier gods assert the cause of Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Submissive I desist, if thou command;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But ah! withdraw this all-destroying hand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hear then my solemn oath, to yield to fate</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unaided Ilion, and her destined state,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till Greece shall gird her with destructive flame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in one ruin sink the Trojan name."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His warm entreaty touch'd Saturnia's ear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She bade the ignipotent his rage forbear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Recall the flame, nor in a mortal cause</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Infest a god: the obedient flame withdraws:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Again the branching streams begin to spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And soft remurmur in their wonted bed.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While these by Juno's will the strife resign,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warring gods in fierce contention join:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wide beneath them groans the rending ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove, as his sport, the dreadful scene descries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And views contending gods with careless eyes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The power of battles lifts his brazen spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And first assaults the radiant queen of war:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What moved thy madness, thus to disunite</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ethereal minds, and mix all heaven in fight?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What wonder this, when in thy frantic mood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou drovest a mortal to insult a god?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy impious hand Tydides' javelin bore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And madly bathed it in celestial gore."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and smote the long-resounding shield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which bears Jove's thunder on its dreadful field:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The adamantine aegis of her sire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That turns the glancing bolt and forked fire.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A stone, the limit of the neighbouring land,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There fix'd from eldest times; black, craggy, vast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This at the heavenly homicide she cast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thundering he falls, a mass of monstrous size:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And seven broad acres covers as he lies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud o'er the fields his ringing arms resound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The scornful dame her conquest views with smiles,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, glorying, thus the prostrate god reviles:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hast thou not yet, insatiate fury! known</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How far Minerva's force transcends thy own?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Juno, whom thou rebellious darest withstand,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Corrects thy folly thus by Pallas' hand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And partial aid to Troy's perfidious race."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The goddess spoke, and turn'd her eyes away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That, beaming round, diffused celestial day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove's Cyprian daughter, stooping on the land,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lent to the wounded god her tender hand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Slowly he rises, scarcely breathes with pain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, propp'd on her fair arm, forsakes the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This the bright empress of the heavens survey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, scoffing, thus to war's victorious maid:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Lo! what an aid on Mars's side is seen!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The smiles' and loves' unconquerable queen!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mark with what insolence, in open view,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She moves: let Pallas, if she dares, pursue."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Minerva smiling heard, the pair o'ertook,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And slightly on her breast the wanton strook:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She, unresisting, fell (her spirits fled);</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On earth together lay the lovers spread.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"And like these heroes be the fate of all</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Minerva cries) who guard the Trojan wall!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Grecian gods such let the Phrygian be,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So dread, so fierce, as Venus is to me;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then from the lowest stone shall Troy be moved."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus she, and Juno with a smile approved.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime, to mix in more than mortal fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god of ocean dares the god of light.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What sloth has seized us, when the fields around</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ring with conflicting powers, and heaven returns the sound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall, ignominious, we with shame retire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No deed perform'd, to our Olympian sire?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Come, prove thy arm! for first the war to wage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Suits not my greatness, or superior age:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rash as thou art to prop the Trojan throne,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And guard the race of proud Laomedon!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hast thou forgot, how, at the monarch's prayer,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">We shared the lengthen'd labours of a year?</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when the circling seasons in their train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Brought back the grateful day that crown'd our pain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With menace stern the fraudful king defied</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our latent godhead, and the prize denied:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mad as he was, he threaten'd servile bands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And doom'd us exiles far in barbarous lands.<note place="foot"><p>"This tale of the temporary servitude of particular gods, by

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Incensed, we heavenward fled with swiftest wing,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And destined vengeance on the perjured king.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dost thou, for this, afford proud Ilion grace,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like us, their present, future sons destroy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from its deep foundations heave their Troy?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Apollo thus: "To combat for mankind</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ill suits the wisdom of celestial mind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For what is man? Calamitous by birth,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To their own hands commit the frantic scene,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor mix immortals in a cause so mean."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then turns his face, far-beaming heavenly fires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from the senior power submiss retires:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him thus retreating, Artemis upbraids,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The quiver'd huntress of the sylvan shades:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"And is it thus the youthful Phoebus flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And yields to ocean's hoary sire the prize?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How vain that martial pomp, and dreadful show</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of pointed arrows and the silver bow!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now boast no more in yon celestial bower,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy force can match the great earth-shaking power."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Silent he heard the queen of woods upbraid:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so Saturnia bore the vaunting maid:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But furious thus: "What insolence has driven</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy pride to face the majesty of heaven?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What though by Jove the female plague design'd,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">She said, and seized her wrists with eager rage;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These in her left hand lock'd, her right untied</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bow, the quiver, and its plumy pride.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">About her temples flies the busy bow;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The scattering arrows, rattling from the case,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drop round, and idly mark the dusty place.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift from the field the baffled huntress flies,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Not fated yet to die;) there safe retreats,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke; and pass'd: Latona, stooping low,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Collects the scatter'd shafts and fallen bow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That, glittering on the dust, lay here and there</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dishonour'd relics of Diana's war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then swift pursued her to her blest abode,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where, all confused, she sought the sovereign god;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Weeping, she grasp'd his knees: the ambrosial vest</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shook with her sighs, and panted on her breast.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sire superior smiled, and bade her show</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What heavenly hand had caused his daughter's woe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Abash'd, she names his own imperial spouse;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the pale crescent fades upon her brows.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus they above: while, swiftly gliding down,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Apollo enters Ilion's sacred town;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The guardian-god now trembled for her wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fear'd the Greeks, though fate forbade her fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Back to Olympus, from the war's alarms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Return the shining bands of gods in arms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some proud in triumph, some with rage on fire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And take their thrones around the ethereal sire.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through blood, through death, Achilles still proceeds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er slaughter'd heroes, and o'er rolling steeds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when avenging flames with fury driven</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The pale inhabitants, some fall, some fly;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the red vapours purple all the sky:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So raged Achilles: death and dire dismay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And toils, and terrors, fill'd the dreadful day.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on a turret hoary Priam stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And marks the waste of his destructive hands;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the near hero rising on his sight!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No stop, no check, no aid! With feeble pace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And settled sorrow on his aged face,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fast as he could, he sighing quits the walls;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus descending, on the guards he calls:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"You to whose care our city-gates belong,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He comes, and desolation marks his way!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when within the walls our troops take breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Phoebus rush'd forth, the flying bands to meet;</l>
<pb n="388" /><anchor id="Pg388" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck slaughter back, and cover'd the retreat,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gladsome see their last escape from fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thither, all parch'd with thirst, a heartless train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gasping, panting, fainting, labour on</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Enraged Achilles follows with his spear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wild with revenge, insatiable of war.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then had the Greeks eternal praise acquired,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Troy inglorious to her walls retired;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But he, the god who darts ethereal flame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shot down to save her, and redeem her fame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To young Agenor force divine he gave;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Antenor's offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In aid of him, beside the beech he sate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wrapt in clouds, restrain'd the hand of fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When now the generous youth Achilles spies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What, shall I fly this terror of the plain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like others fly, and be like others slain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain hope! to shun him by the self-same road</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yon line of slaughter'd Trojans lately trod.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No: with the common heap I scorn to fall—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What if they pass'd me to the Trojan wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While I decline to yonder path, that leads</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Ida's forests and surrounding shades?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So may I reach, conceal'd, the cooling flood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From my tired body wash the dirt and blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As soon as night her dusky veil extends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Return in safety to my Trojan friends.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What if?—But wherefore all this vain debate?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such is his swiftness, 'tis in vain to fly,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And such his valour, that who stands must die.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Howe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here, and in public view, to meet my fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet sure he too is mortal; he may feel</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One only soul informs that dreadful frame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Jove's sole favour gives him all his fame."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and stood, collected, in his might;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all his beating bosom claim'd the fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Roused from his thicket by a storm of darts:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Untaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the barb'd javelin stings his breast in vain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not less resolved, Antenor's valiant heir</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confronts Achilles, and awaits the war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Disdainful of retreat: high held before,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His shield (a broad circumference) he bore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then graceful as he stood, in act to throw</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"How proud Achilles glories in his fame!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hopes this day to sink the Trojan name</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath her ruins! Know, that hope is vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Parents and children our just arms employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And strong and many are the sons of Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great as thou art, even thou may'st stain with gore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These Phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: with matchless force the javelin flung</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Smote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He stands impassive in the ethereal arms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then fiercely rushing on the daring foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god-like Trojan in a veil of clouds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dismiss'd with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile the god, to cover their escape,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Assumes Agenor's habit, voice and shape,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Flies from the furious chief in this disguise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The furious chief still follows where he flies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now o'er the fields they stretch with lengthen'd strides,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now urge the course where swift Scamander glides:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god, now distant scarce a stride before,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While all the flying troops their speed employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pour on heaps into the walls of Troy:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who 'scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sudden joy confused, and mix'd affright.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And nations breathe, deliver'd from their fate.</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE DEATH OF HECTOR.</p>

<p>The Trojans being safe within the walls, Hector only stays to oppose
Achilles. Priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his
son to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain.
Hector consults within himself what measures to take; but at the
advance of Achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies. Achilles
pursues him thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning
the fate of Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles.
She deludes Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat, and
is slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of
Priam and Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their cries
reach the ears of Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into
the inner part of the palace: she mounts up to the walls, and beholds
her dead husband. She swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief and
lamentation.</p>

<p>The thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls, and
on the battlements of Troy.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The herded Ilians rush like driven deer:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There safe they wipe the briny drops away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And drown in bowls the labours of the day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close to the walls, advancing o'er the fields</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath one roof of well-compacted shields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">March, bending on, the Greeks' embodied powers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far stretching in the shade of Trojan towers.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Hector singly stay'd: chain'd down by fate</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There fix'd he stood before the Scaean gate;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still his bold arms determined to employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The guardian still of long-defended Troy.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Apollo now to tired Achilles turns:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The power confess'd in all his glory burns:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"And what (he cries) has Peleus' son in view,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With mortal speed a godhead to pursue?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For not to thee to know the gods is given,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unskill'd to trace the latent marks of heaven.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What boots thee now, that Troy forsook the plain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain thy past labour, and thy present vain:</l>
<pb n="391" /><anchor id="Pg391" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe in their walls are now her troops bestow'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While here thy frantic rage attacks a god."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief incensed—"Too partial god of day!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To check my conquests in the middle way:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How few in Ilion else had refuge found!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What gasping numbers now had bit the ground!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou robb'st me of a glory justly mine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Powerful of godhead, and of fraud divine:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To cheat a mortal who repines in vain."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then to the city, terrible and strong,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With high and haughty steps he tower'd along,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So the proud courser, victor of the prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the near goal with double ardour flies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him, as he blazing shot across the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The careful eyes of Priam first beheld.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not half so dreadful rises to the sight,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Not half so dreadful.</hi></p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">     "On the other side,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Incensed with indignation, Satan stood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unterrified, and like a comet burn'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In the arctic sky, and from his horrid hair</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shakes pestilence and war."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Orion's dog (the year when autumn weighs),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And o'er the feebler stars exerts his rays;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Terrific glory! for his burning breath</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He strikes his reverend head, now white with age;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He lifts his wither'd arms; obtests the skies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son, resolved Achilles' force to dare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full at the Scaean gates expects the war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the sad father on the rampart stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus adjures him with extended hands:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Methinks already I behold thee slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stretch'd beneath that fury of the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Implacable Achilles! might'st thou be</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To all the gods no dearer than to me!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How many valiant sons I late enjoy'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Valiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two from one mother sprung, my Polydore,</l>
<pb n="392" /><anchor id="Pg392" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Their grandsire's wealth, by right of birth their own,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Consign'd his daughter with Lelegia's throne:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All pale they wander on the Stygian coast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What sorrows then must their sad mother know,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What anguish I? unutterable woe!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet less that anguish, less to her, to me,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Less to all Troy, if not deprived of thee.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet shun Achilles! enter yet the wall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Save thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Neglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While yet thy father feels the woes he bears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(All trembling on the verge of helpless age)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bitter dregs of fortune's cup to drain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And number all his days by miseries!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My heroes slain, my bridal bed o'erturn'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My daughters ravish'd, and my city burn'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My bleeding infants dash'd against the floor;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These I have yet to see, perhaps yet more!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Perhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The last sad relic of my ruin'd state,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stain the pavement of my regal hall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where famish'd dogs, late guardians of my door,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall lick their mangled master's spatter'd gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet for my sons I thank ye, gods! 'tis well;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Well have they perish'd, for in fight they fell.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when the fates, in fulness of their rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spurn the hoar head of unresisting age,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In dust the reverend lineaments deform,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This, this is misery! the last, the worse,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and acting what no words could say,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rent from his head the silver locks away.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With him the mournful mother bears a part;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet all her sorrows turn not Hector's heart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The zone unbraced, her bosom she display'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Have mercy on me, O my son! revere</l>
<pb n="393" /><anchor id="Pg393" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The words of age; attend a parent's prayer!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If ever thee in these fond arms I press'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or still'd thy infant clamours at this breast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah do not thus our helpless years forego,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But, by our walls secured, repel the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against his rage if singly thou proceed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should'st thou, (but Heaven avert it!) should'st thou bleed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor must thy corse lie honour'd on the bier,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far from our pious rites those dear remains</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Must feast the vultures on the naked plains."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But fix'd remains the purpose of his soul;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Resolved he stands, and with a fiery glance</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Expects the hero's terrible advance.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So, roll'd up in his den, the swelling snake</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beholds the traveller approach the brake;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Have gather'd half the poisons of the plains;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He burns, he stiffens with collected ire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his red eyeballs glare with living fire.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath a turret, on his shield reclined,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He stood, and question'd thus his mighty mind:<note place="foot"><p>"And thus his own undaunted mind explores."—"Paradise
Lost," vi. 113.</p></note></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Where lies my way? to enter in the wall?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall proud Polydamas before the gate</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proclaim, his counsels are obey'd too late,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which timely follow'd but the former night,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What numbers had been saved by Hector's flight?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That wise advice rejected with disdain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I feel my folly in my people slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Methinks my suffering country's voice I hear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But most her worthless sons insult my ear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On my rash courage charge the chance of war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And blame those virtues which they cannot share.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No—if I e'er return, return I must</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Glorious, my country's terror laid in dust:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or if I perish, let her see me fall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In field at least, and fighting for her wall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And yet suppose these measures I forego,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Approach unarm'd, and parley with the foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And treat on terms of peace to save the town:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Cause of the war, and grievance of the land)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With honourable justice to restore:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And add half Ilion's yet remaining store,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which Troy shall, sworn, produce; that injured Greece</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">May share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace.</l>
<pb n="394" /><anchor id="Pg394" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But why this thought? Unarm'd if I should go,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">We greet not here, as man conversing man,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Met at an oak, or journeying o'er a plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No season now for calm familiar talk,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like youths and maidens in an evening walk:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">War is our business, but to whom is given</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To die, or triumph, that, determine Heaven!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His dreadful plumage nodded from on high;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Pelian javelin, in his better hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shot trembling rays that glitter'd o'er the land;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And on his breast the beamy splendour shone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like Jove's own lightning, or the rising sun.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles follows like the winged wind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus at the panting dove a falcon flies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The swiftest racer of the liquid skies),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Just when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Obliquely wheeling through the aerial way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With open beak and shrilling cries he springs,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No less fore-right the rapid chase they held,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One urged by fury, one by fear impell'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now circling round the walls their course maintain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where the high watch-tower overlooks the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(A wider compass,) smoke along the road.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next by Scamander's double source they bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where two famed fountains burst the parted ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With exhalations steaming to the skies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That the green banks in summer's heat o'erflows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like crystal clear, and cold as winter snows:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each gushing fount a marble cistern fills,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose polish'd bed receives the falling rills;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where Trojan dames (ere yet alarm'd by Greece)</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">No vulgar victim must reward the day:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Some golden tripod, or some lovely dame)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The panting coursers swiftly turn the goal,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And with them turns the raised spectator's soul:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus three times round the Trojan wall they fly.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gazing gods lean forward from the sky;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom, while eager on the chase they look,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sire of mortals and immortals spoke:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Unworthy sight! the man beloved of heaven,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold, inglorious round yon city driven!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My heart partakes the generous Hector's pain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Ida's summits, and the towers of Troy:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now see him flying; to his fears resign'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fate, and fierce Achilles, close behind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Consult, ye powers! ('tis worthy your debate)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whether to snatch him from impending fate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or let him bear, by stern Pelides slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Good as he is) the lot imposed on man."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Pallas thus: "Shall he whose vengeance forms</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The forky bolt, and blackens heaven with storms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall he prolong one Trojan's forfeit breath?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A man, a mortal, pre-ordain'd to death!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And will no murmurs fill the courts above?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No gods indignant blame their partial Jove?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Go then (return'd the sire) without delay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Exert thy will: I give the Fates their way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift at the mandate pleased Tritonia flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As through the forest, o'er the vale and lawn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The well-breath'd beagle drives the flying fawn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain he tries the covert of the brakes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sure of the vapour in the tainted dews,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The certain hound his various maze pursues.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus step by step, where'er the Trojan wheel'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There swift Achilles compass'd round the field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oft as to reach the Dardan gates he bends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hopes the assistance of his pitying friends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Whose showering arrows, as he coursed below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the high turrets might oppress the foe,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So oft Achilles turns him to the plain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He eyes the city, but he eyes in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As men in slumbers seem with speedy pace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One to pursue, and one to lead the chase,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor this can fly, nor that can overtake:</l>
<pb n="396" /><anchor id="Pg396" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No less the labouring heroes pant and strain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While that but flies, and this pursues in vain.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What god, O muse, assisted Hector's force</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With fate itself so long to hold the course?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Phoebus it was; who, in his latest hour,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Endued his knees with strength, his nerves with power:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And great Achilles, lest some Greek's advance</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should snatch the glory from his lifted lance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sign'd to the troops to yield his foe the way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And leave untouch'd the honours of the day.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove lifts the golden balances, that show</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fates of mortal men, and things below:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here each contending hero's lot he tries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And weighs, with equal hand, their destinies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Low sinks the scale surcharged with Hector's fate;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Phoebus left him. Fierce Minerva flies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To stern Pelides, and triumphing, cries:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O loved of Jove! this day our labours cease,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And conquest blazes with full beams on Greece.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Hector falls; that Hector famed so far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drunk with renown, insatiable of war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Falls by thy hand, and mine! nor force, nor flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall more avail him, nor his god of light.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">See, where in vain he supplicates above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Roll'd at the feet of unrelenting Jove;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rest here: myself will lead the Trojan on,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And urge to meet the fate he cannot shun."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her voice divine the chief with joyful mind</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Obey'd; and rested, on his lance reclined</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While like Deiphobus the martial dame</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Her face, her gesture, and her arms the same),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In show an aid, by hapless Hector's side</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Approach'd, and greets him thus with voice belied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Too long, O Hector! have I borne the sight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of this distress, and sorrow'd in thy flight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It fits us now a noble stand to make,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And here, as brothers, equal fates partake."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then he: "O prince! allied in blood and fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dearer than all that own a brother's name;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of all that Hecuba to Priam bore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long tried, long loved: much loved, but honoured more!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Since you, of all our numerous race alone</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Defend my life, regardless of your own."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Again the goddess: "Much my father's prayer,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And much my mother's, press'd me to forbear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But stronger love impell'd, and I obey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Come then, the glorious conflict let us try,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or let us stretch Achilles on the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or to his arm our bloody trophies yield."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fraudful she said; then swiftly march'd before:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sternly they met. The silence Hector broke:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Enough, O son of Peleus! Troy has view'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her walls thrice circled, and her chief pursued.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But now some god within me bids me try</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thine, or my fate: I kill thee, or I die.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet on the verge of battle let us stay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And for a moment's space suspend the day;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let Heaven's high powers be call'd to arbitrate</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The just conditions of this stern debate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Eternal witnesses of all below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And faithful guardians of the treasured vow!)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To them I swear; if, victor in the strife,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove by these hands shall shed thy noble life,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stripp'd of its arms alone (the conqueror's due)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rest to Greece uninjured I'll restore:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now plight thy mutual oath, I ask no more."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Talk not of oaths (the dreadful chief replies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Detested as thou art, and ought to be,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor oath nor pact Achilles plights with thee:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such leagues as men and furious lions join,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To such I call the gods! one constant state</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of lasting rancour and eternal hate:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No thought but rage, and never-ceasing strife,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till death extinguish rage, and thought, and life.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rouse then thy forces this important hour,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Collect thy soul, and call forth all thy power.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No further subterfuge, no further chance;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis Pallas, Pallas gives thee to my lance.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each Grecian ghost, by thee deprived of breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now hovers round, and calls thee to thy death."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and launch'd his javelin at the foe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Hector shunn'd the meditated blow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He stoop'd, while o'er his head the flying spear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sang innocent, and spent its force in air.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Minerva watch'd it falling on the land,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then drew, and gave to great Achilles' hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unseen of Hector, who, elate with joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now shakes his lance, and braves the dread of Troy.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"The life you boasted to that javelin given,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prince! you have miss'd. My fate depends on Heaven,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To thee, presumptuous as thou art, unknown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or what must prove my fortune, or thy own.</l>
<pb n="398" /><anchor id="Pg398" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Boasting is but an art, our fears to blind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And with false terrors sink another's mind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But know, whatever fate I am to try,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By no dishonest wound shall Hector die.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I shall not fall a fugitive at least,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My soul shall bravely issue from my breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But first, try thou my arm; and may this dart</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">End all my country's woes, deep buried in thy heart."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The weapon flew, its course unerring held,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unerring, but the heavenly shield repell'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mortal dart; resulting with a bound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From off the ringing orb, it struck the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector beheld his javelin fall in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor other lance, nor other hope remain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He calls Deiphobus, demands a spear—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain, for no Deiphobus was there.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All comfortless he stands: then, with a sigh;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"'Tis so—Heaven wills it, and my hour is nigh!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I deem'd Deiphobus had heard my call,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But he secure lies guarded in the wall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A god deceived me; Pallas, 'twas thy deed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Death and black fate approach! 'tis I must bleed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No refuge now, no succour from above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Jove deserts me, and the son of Jove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Propitious once, and kind! Then welcome fate!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis true I perish, yet I perish great:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet in a mighty deed I shall expire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let future ages hear it, and admire!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce, at the word, his weighty sword he drew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, all collected, on Achilles flew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Jove's bold bird, high balanced in the air,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor less Achilles his fierce soul prepares:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before his breast the flaming shield he bears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Refulgent orb! above his fourfold cone</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gilded horse-hair sparkled in the sun.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nodding at every step: (Vulcanian frame!)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And as he moved, his figure seem'd on flame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As radiant Hesper shines with keener light,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Hesper shines with keener light.</hi></p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far-beaming o'er the silver host of night,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When all the starry train emblaze the sphere:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">In his right hand he waves the weapon round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eyes the whole man, and meditates the wound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But the rich mail Patroclus lately wore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Securely cased the warrior's body o'er.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One space at length he spies, to let in fate,</l>
<pb n="399" /><anchor id="Pg399" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where 'twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gave entrance: through that penetrable part</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Furious he drove the well-directed dart:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor pierced the windpipe yet, nor took the power</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of speech, unhappy! from thy dying hour.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While, thus triumphing, stern Achilles cries:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"At last is Hector stretch'd upon the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who fear'd no vengeance for Patroclus slain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, prince! you should have fear'd, what now you feel;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles absent was Achilles still:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet a short space the great avenger stayed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then low in dust thy strength and glory laid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Peaceful he sleeps, with all our rites adorn'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For ever honour'd, and for ever mourn'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While cast to all the rage of hostile power,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thee birds shall mangle, and the gods devour."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Hector, fainting at the approach of death:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"By thy own soul! by those who gave thee breath!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By all the sacred prevalence of prayer;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah, leave me not for Grecian dogs to tear!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The common rites of sepulture bestow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To soothe a father's and a mother's woe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let their large gifts procure an urn at least,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Hector's ashes in his country rest."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"No, wretch accursed! relentless he replies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Flames, as he spoke, shot flashing from his eyes;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not those who gave me breath should bid me spare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Could I myself the bloody banquet join!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No—to the dogs that carcase I resign.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should Troy, to bribe me, bring forth all her store,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And giving thousands, offer thousands more;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should Dardan Priam, and his weeping dame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their Hector on the pile they should not see,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus the chief his dying accents drew:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thy rage, implacable! too well I knew:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Furies that relentless breast have steel'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet think, a day will come, when fate's decree</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Phoebus and Paris shall avenge my fate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stretch thee here before the Scaean gate."<note place="foot"><p>Such was his fate. After chasing the Trojans into the town,
he was slain by an arrow from the quiver of Paris, directed under the
unerring auspices of Apollo. The greatest efforts were made by the
Trojans to possess themselves of the body, which was however rescued
and borne off to the Grecian camp by the valour of Ajax and Ulysses.
Thetis stole away the body, just as the Greeks were about to burn it
with funeral honours, and conveyed it away to a renewed life of
immortality in the isle of Leuke in the Euxine.</p></note></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ceased. The Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the dark realm the spirit wings its way,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then forcing backward from the gaping wound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The reeking javelin, cast it on the ground.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">See, if already their deserted towers</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The souls of heroes, their great Hector slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But what is Troy, or glory what to me?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or why reflects my mind on aught but thee,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the sad father answers groans with groans</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tears after tears his mournful cheeks o'erflow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the whole city wears one face of woe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No less than if the rage of hostile fires.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From her foundations curling to her spires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er the proud citadel at length should rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the last blaze send Ilion to the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wretched monarch of the falling state,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Distracted, presses to the Dardan gate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce the whole people stop his desperate course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While strong affliction gives the feeble force:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Grief tears his heart, and drives him to and fro,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In all the raging impotence of woe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At length he roll'd in dust, and thus begun,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Imploring all, and naming one by one:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ah! let me, let me go where sorrow calls;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I, only I, will issue from your walls</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bow before the murderer of my son.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My grief perhaps his pity may engage;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Perhaps at least he may respect my age.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He has a father too; a man like me;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One, not exempt from age and misery</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Vigorous no more, as when his young embrace</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Begot this pest of me, and all my race).</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How many valiant sons, in early bloom,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Has that cursed hand send headlong to the tomb!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thee, Hector! last: thy loss (divinely brave)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sinks my sad soul with sorrow to the grave.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O had thy gentle spirit pass'd in peace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son expiring in the sire's embrace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While both thy parents wept the fatal hour,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, bending o'er thee, mix'd the tender shower!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some comfort that had been, some sad relief,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To melt in full satiety of grief!"</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus wail'd the father, grovelling on the ground,</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.<note place="foot"><p>This book has been
closely imitated by Virgil in his fifth book, but it is almost useless
to attempt a selection of passages for comparison.</p></note></p>

<p>Achilles and the Myrmidons do honours to the body of Patroclus. After
the funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep,
the ghost of his friend appears to him, and demands the rites of
burial; the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons
to fetch wood for the pyre. The funeral procession, and the offering
their hair to the dead. Achilles sacrifices several animals, and lastly
twelve Trojan captives, at the pile; then sets fire to it. He pays
libations to the Winds, which (at the instance of Iris) rise, and raise
the flames. When the pile has burned all night, they gather the bones,
place them in an urn of gold, and raise the tomb. Achilles institutes
the funeral games: the chariot-race, the fight of the caestus, the
wrestling, the foot-race, the single combat, the discus, the shooting
with arrows, the darting the javelin: the various descriptions of
which, and the various success of the several antagonists, make the
greatest part of the book.</p>

<p>In this book ends the thirtieth day. The night following, the ghost of
Patroclus appears to Achilles: the one-and-thirtieth day is employed in
felling the timber for the pile: the two-and-thirtieth in burning it;
and the three-and-thirtieth in the games. The scene is generally on the
sea-shore.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus humbled in the dust, the pensive train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the sad city mourn'd her hero slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The body soil'd with dust, and black with gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies on broad Hellespont's resounding shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Grecians seek their ships, and clear the strand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All, but the martial Myrmidonian band:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These yet assembled great Achilles holds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the stern purpose of his mind unfolds:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Not yet, my brave companions of the war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Release your smoking coursers from the car;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But, with his chariot each in order led,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Perform due honours to Patroclus dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ere yet from rest or food we seek relief,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some rites remain, to glut our rage of grief."</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The troops obey'd; and thrice in order led<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Thrice in order led.</hi> This was a frequent rite at
funerals. The Romans had the same custom, which they called
<hi rend="font-style: italic">decursio.</hi> Plutarch states that Alexander, in after times,
renewed these same honours to the memory of Achilles himself.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Achilles first) their coursers round the dead;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thrice their sorrows and laments renew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tears bathe their arms, and tears the sands bedew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For such a warrior Thetis aids their woe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Melts their strong hearts, and bids their eyes to flow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But chief, Pelides: thick-succeeding sighs</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Burst from his heart, and torrents from his eyes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His slaughtering hands, yet red with blood, he laid</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On his dead friend's cold breast, and thus he said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"All hail, Patroclus! let thy honour'd ghost</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hear, and rejoice on Pluto's dreary coast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold! Achilles' promise is complete;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bloody Hector stretch'd before thy feet.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! to the dogs his carcase I resign;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And twelve sad victims, of the Trojan line,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sacred to vengeance, instant shall expire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their lives effused around thy funeral pyre."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gloomy he said, and (horrible to view)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before the bier the bleeding Hector threw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone on the dust. The Myrmidons around</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unbraced their armour, and the steeds unbound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All to Achilles' sable ship repair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Frequent and full, the genial feast to share.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bristly victims hissing o'er the fire:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler cries</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Expires the goat; the sheep in silence dies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around the hero's prostrate body flow'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now a band of Argive monarchs brings</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The glorious victor to the king of kings.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his dead friend the pensive warrior went,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With steps unwilling, to the regal tent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The attending heralds, as by office bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With kindled flames the tripod-vase surround:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They urged in vain; the chief refused, and swore:<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">And swore.</hi> Literally, and called Orcus, the god of
oaths, to witness. See Buttmann, Lexilog, p. 436.</p></note></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till on the pyre I place thee; till I rear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The grassy mound, and clip thy sacred hair.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some ease at least those pious rites may give,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And soothe my sorrows, while I bear to live.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Howe'er, reluctant as I am, I stay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And share your feast; but with the dawn of day,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">(O king of men!) it claims thy royal care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That Greece the warrior's funeral pile prepare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bid the forests fall: (such rites are paid</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To heroes slumbering in eternal shade:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, when his earthly part shall mount in fire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke: they hear him, and the word obey;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rage of hunger and of thirst allay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then ease in sleep the labours of the day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But great Pelides, stretch'd along the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where, dash'd on rocks, the broken billows roar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies inly groaning; while on either hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The martial Myrmidons confusedly stand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Along the grass his languid members fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tired with his chase around the Trojan wall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hush'd by the murmurs of the rolling deep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When lo! the shade, before his closing eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of sad Patroclus rose, or seem'd to rise:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In the same robe he living wore, he came:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The form familiar hover'd o'er his head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"And sleeps Achilles? (thus the phantom said:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sleeps my Achilles, his Patroclus dead?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Living, I seem'd his dearest, tenderest care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But now forgot, I wander in the air.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let my pale corse the rites of burial know,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And give me entrance in the realms below:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till then the spirit finds no resting-place,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But here and there the unbodied spectres chase</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The vagrant dead around the dark abode,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forbid to cross the irremeable flood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now give thy hand; for to the farther shore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When once we pass, the soul returns no more:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When once the last funereal flames ascend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more shall meet Achilles and his friend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more our thoughts to those we loved make known;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or quit the dearest, to converse alone.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Me fate has sever'd from the sons of earth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fate fore-doom'd that waited from my birth:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thee too it waits; before the Trojan wall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even great and godlike thou art doom'd to fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hear then; and as in fate and love we join,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Together have we lived; together bred,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One house received us, and one table fed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That golden urn, thy goddess-mother gave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">May mix our ashes in one common grave."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Twas when, emerging through the shades of night.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Four ample measures held the shining frame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two golden talents for the fourth were placed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">An ample double bowl contents the last.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These in fair order ranged upon the plain,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not those who trust in chariots and in horse.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain, unskilful to the goal they strive,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And short, or wide, the ungovern'd courser drive:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While with sure skill, though with inferior steeds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The knowing racer to his end proceeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd on the goal his eye foreruns the course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His hand unerring steers the steady horse,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now contracts, or now extends the rein,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Observing still the foremost on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mark then the goal, 'tis easy to be found;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of some once stately oak the last remains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or hardy fir, unperish'd with the rains:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Inclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And round, a circle for the wheeling car.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or then, as now, the limit of a race.)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bear close to this, and warily proceed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A little bending to the left-hand steed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But urge the right, and give him all the reins;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thy strict hand his fellow's head restrains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,</l>
<pb n="415" /><anchor id="Pg415" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wheel's round naves appear to brush the goal.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Clear of the stony heap direct the course;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lest through incaution failing, thou mayst be</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A joy to others, a reproach to me.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And leave unskilful swiftness far behind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or the famed race, through all the regions known,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That whirl'd the car of proud Laomedon."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Concludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next bold Meriones was seen to rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The last, but not least ardent for the prize.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They mount their seats; the lots their place dispose</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Roll'd in his helmet, these Achilles throws).</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Young Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And next the brother of the king of men:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They stand in order, an impatient train:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pelides points the barrier on the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sends before old Phoenix to the place,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To mark the racers, and to judge the race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once the coursers from the barrier bound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lifted scourges all at once resound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And up the champaign thunder from the shore:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Float in their speed, and dance upon the wind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While hot for fame, and conquest all their care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Each o'er his flying courser hung in air,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Erect with ardour, poised upon the rein,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now (the last compass fetch'd around the goal)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At the near prize each gathers all his soul,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each burns with double hope, with double pain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close on Eumelus' back they puff the wind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And seem just mounting on his car behind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, hovering o'er, their stretching shadows sees.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;</l>
<pb n="416" /><anchor id="Pg416" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But angry Phoebus to Tydides flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His matchless horses' labour on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Snatch'd from his hope the glories of the day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Springs to her knight, and gives the scourge again,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She breaks his rival's chariot from the yoke:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more their way the startled horses held;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The car reversed came rattling on the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone on the dust the unhappy master fell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His batter'd face and elbows strike the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish'd wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Grief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before him far the glad Tydides flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Minerva's spirit drives his matchless pace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And crowns him victor of the labour'd race.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thus young Nestor animates his steeds:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not that we hope to match Tydides' horse,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Since great Minerva wings their rapid way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gives their lord the honours of the day;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your swiftness? vanquish'd by a female foe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through your neglect, if lagging on the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The last ignoble gift be all we gain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more shall Nestor's hand your food supply,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The old man's fury rises, and ye die.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Presents the occasion, could we use it right."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus he. The coursers at their master's threat</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now Antilochus with nice survey</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Observes the compass of the hollow way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fast by the road a precipice was worn:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Spartan hero's chariot smoked along.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close up the venturous youth resolves to keep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still edging near, and bears him toward the steep.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Atrides, trembling, casts his eye below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wonders at the rashness of his foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hold, stay your steeds—What madness thus to ride</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This narrow way! take larger field (he cried),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or both must fall."—Atrides cried in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far as an able arm the disk can send,</l>
<pb n="417" /><anchor id="Pg417" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When youthful rivals their full force extend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before the king: he, cautious, backward drew</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His horse compell'd; foreboding in his fears</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rattling ruin of the clashing cars,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The floundering coursers rolling on the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But thus upbraids his rival as he flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go, but expect not I'll the prize resign;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine—"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then to his steeds with all his force he cries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your rivals, destitute of youthful force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With fainting knees shall labour in the course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And yield the glory yours."—The steeds obey;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already at their heels they wing their way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And seem already to retrieve the day.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The coursers bounding o'er the dusty field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The first who mark'd them was the Cretan king;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on a rising ground, above the ring,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The monarch sat: from whence with sure survey</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He well observed the chief who led the way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heard from far his animating cries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On whose broad front a blaze of shining white,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Are yonder horse discern'd by me alone?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or can ye, all, another chief survey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And other steeds than lately led the way?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lie sure disabled in the middle field:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For, since the goal they doubled, round the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I search to find them, but I search in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Perchance the reins forsook the driver's hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, turn'd too short, he tumbled on the strand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shot from the chariot; while his coursers stray</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With frantic fury from the destined way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rise then some other, and inform my sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great Ætolian chief, renown'd in war."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Old man! (Oileus rashly thus replies)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eumelus' steeds, high bounding in the chase,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still, as at first, unrivall'd lead the race:</l>
<pb n="418" /><anchor id="Pg418" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I well discern him, as he shakes the rein,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hear his shouts victorious o'er the plain."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Contentious prince, of all the Greeks beside</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The last in merit, as the first in pride!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To vile reproach what answer can we make?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A goblet or a tripod let us stake,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And be the king the judge. The most unwise</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Will learn their rashness, when they pay the price."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To fell extremes. But Thetis' godlike son</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Awful amidst them rose, and thus begun:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Much would ye blame, should others thus offend:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lo! the approaching steeds your contest end."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High o'er his head the circling lash he wields:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Refulgent through the cloud: no eye could find</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The track his flying wheels had left behind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So swift, it seem'd a flight, and not a race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now victor at the goal Tydides stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Quits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These to the ships his train triumphant leads,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Young Nestor follows (who by art, not force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'erpass'd Atrides) second in the course.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behind, Atrides urged the race, more near</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Than to the courser in his swift career</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The following car, just touching with his heel</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such, and so narrow now the space between</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rivals, late so distant on the green;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So soon swift Æthe her lost ground regain'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One length, one moment, had the race obtain'd.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Merion pursued, at greater distance still,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With tardier coursers, and inferior skill.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Last came, Admetus! thy unhappy son;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Slow dragged the steeds his batter'd chariot on:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles saw, and pitying thus begun:</l>
</lg>

<pb n="419" /><anchor id="Pg419" />

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Behold! the man whose matchless art surpass'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sons of Greece! the ablest, yet the last!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fortune denies, but justice bids us pay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Since great Tydides bears the first away)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him the second honours of the day."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks consent with loud-applauding cries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And then Eumelus had received the prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But youthful Nestor, jealous of his fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The award opposes, and asserts his claim.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Think not (he cries) I tamely will resign,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O Peleus' son! the mare so justly mine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What if the gods, the skilful to confound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And vows omitted forfeited the prize.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If yet (distinction to thy friend to show,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And please a soul desirous to bestow)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some gift must grace Eumelus, view thy store</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of beauteous handmaids, steeds, and shining ore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">An ample present let him thence receive,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But this my prize I never shall forego;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This, who but touches, warriors! is my foe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spake the youth; nor did his words offend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pleased with the well-turn'd flattery of a friend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles smiled: "The gift proposed (he cried),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antilochus! we shall ourself provide.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With plates of brass the corslet cover'd o'er,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The same renown'd Asteropaeus wore,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose glittering margins raised with silver shine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(No vulgar gift,) Eumelus! shall be thine."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: Automedon at his command</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The corslet brought, and gave it to his hand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Distinguish'd by his friend, his bosom glows</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With generous joy: then Menelaus rose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The herald placed the sceptre in his hands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And still'd the clamour of the shouting bands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not without cause incensed at Nestor's son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And inly grieving, thus the king begun:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"The praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">An act so rash, Antilochus! has stain'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Robb'd of my glory and my just reward,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To you, O Grecians! be my wrong declared:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So not a leader shall our conduct blame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or judge me envious of a rival's fame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What needs appealing in a fact so plain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What Greek shall blame me, if I bid thee rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And vindicate by oath th' ill-gotten prize?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rise if thou darest, before thy chariot stand,</l>
<pb n="420" /><anchor id="Pg420" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Was but to conquer, not to circumvent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swear by that god whose liquid arms surround</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The globe, and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prudent chief with calm attention heard;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then mildly thus: "Excuse, if youth have err'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Superior as thou art, forgive the offence,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor I thy equal, or in years, or sense.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou know'st the errors of unripen'd age,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Weak are its counsels, headlong is its rage.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prize I quit, if thou thy wrath resign;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mare, or aught thou ask'st, be freely thine</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ere I become (from thy dear friendship torn)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So spoke Antilochus; and at the word</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mare contested to the king restored.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Joy swells his soul: as when the vernal grain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lifts the green ear above the springing plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fields their vegetable life renew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And laugh and glitter with the morning dew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such joy the Spartan's shining face o'erspread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lifted his gay heart, while thus he said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Still may our souls, O generous youth! agree</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis now Atrides' turn to yield to thee.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rash heat perhaps a moment might control,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not break, the settled temper of thy soul.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not but (my friend) 'tis still the wiser way</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To waive contention with superior sway;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For ah! how few, who should like thee offend,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said; and pleased his passion to command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Resign'd the courser to Noemon's hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Friend of the youthful chief: himself content,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But left the glory of the past thy own."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and placed the goblet at his side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With joy the venerable king replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Wisely and well, my son, thy words have proved</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A senior honour'd, and a friend beloved!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Too true it is, deserted of my strength,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These wither'd arms and limbs have fail'd at length.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh! had I now that force I felt of yore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Known through Buprasium and the Pylian shore!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Victorious then in every solemn game,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ordain'd to Amarynces' mighty name;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brave Epeians gave my glory way,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Phyleus and Polydorus with the spear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sons of Actor won the prize of horse,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But won by numbers, not by art or force:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">One lash'd the coursers, while one ruled the reins.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such once I was! Now to these tasks succeeds</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A younger race, that emulate our deeds:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I yield, alas! (to age who must not yield?)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though once the foremost hero of the field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go thou, my son! by generous friendship led,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proud of the gift, thus spake the full of days:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles heard him, prouder of the praise.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prizes next are order'd to the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For the bold champions who the caestus wield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of six years' age, unconscious of the yoke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is to the circus led, and firmly bound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next stands a goblet, massy, large, and round.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles rising, thus: "Let Greece excite</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two heroes equal to this hardy fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">On whom Apollo shall the palm bestow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And whom the Greeks supreme by conquest know,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This mule his dauntless labours shall repay,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">This dreadful combat great Epeus chose;<note place="foot"><p>Virgil, by making the boaster vanquished, has drawn a better
moral from this episode than Homer. The following lines deserve
comparison:—</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"The haughty Dares in the lists appears:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Walking he strides, his head erected bears:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">*          *          *          *</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such Dares was, and such he strode along,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And drew the wonder of the gazing throng</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His brawny breast and ample chest he shows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His lifted arms around his head he throws,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And deals in whistling air his empty blows.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His match is sought, but, through the trembling band,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No one dares answer to the proud demand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already he devours the promised prize.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">*          *          *          *</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If none my matchless valour dares oppose,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">High o'er the crowd, enormous bulk! he rose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And seized the beast, and thus began to say:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Stand forth some man, to bear the bowl away!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Price of his ruin: for who dares deny</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This mule my right; the undoubted victor I)</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">So let his friends be nigh, a needful train,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The host beheld him, silent with amaze!</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To meet his might, and emulate thy sire,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amid the circle now each champion stands,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And painful sweat from all their members flows.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At length Epeus dealt a weighty blow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the cheek of his unwary foe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath that ponderous arm's resistless sway</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Down dropp'd he, nerveless, and extended lay.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As a large fish, when winds and waters roar,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies panting; not less batter'd with his wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bleeding hero pants upon the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose arms support him, reeling through the throng,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dragging his disabled legs along;</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The third bold game Achilles next demands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And calls the wrestlers to the level sands:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A massy tripod for the victor lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of twice six oxen its reputed price;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And next, the loser's spirits to restore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A female captive, valued but at four.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife prop</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amid the ring each nervous rival stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Embracing rigid with implicit hands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close lock'd above, their heads and arms are mix'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Below, their planted feet at distance fix'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like two strong rafters which the builder forms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their tops connected, but at wider space</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd on the centre stands their solid base.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now to the grasp each manly body bends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The humid sweat from every pore descends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor could Ulysses, for his art renown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The watchful caution of his artful foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the long strife even tired the lookers on,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prove we our force, and Jove the rest decree."</l>
</lg>

<pb n="424" /><anchor id="Pg424" />

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With matchless strength; that time Ulysses found</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The strength to evade, and where the nerves combine</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His ankle struck: the giant fell supine;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses, following, on his bosom lies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He barely stirr'd him, but he could not raise:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His knee lock'd fast, the foe's attempt denied;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And grappling close, they tumbled side by side.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Defiled with honourable dust they roll,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Again they rage, again to combat rise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When great Achilles thus divides the prize:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Your noble vigour, O my friends, restrain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor weary out your generous strength in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ye both have won: let others who excel,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now prove that prowess you have proved so well."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero's words the willing chiefs obey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From their tired bodies wipe the dust away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, clothed anew, the following games survey.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now succeed the gifts ordain'd to grace</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youths contending in the rapid race:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A silver urn that full six measures held,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By none in weight or workmanship excell'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Elaborate, with artifice divine;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From him descended, good Eunaeus heir'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now, the same hero's funeral rites to grace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It stands the prize of swiftness in the race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A well-fed ox was for the second placed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And half a talent must content the last.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles rising then bespoke the train:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero said, and starting from his place,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oilean Ajax rises to the race;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses next; and he whose speed surpass'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His youthful equals, Nestor's son, the last.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ranged in a line the ready racers stand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pelides points the barrier with his hand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All start at once; Oileus led the race;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behind him, diligently close, he sped,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As closely following as the running thread</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spindle follows, and displays the charms</l>
<pb n="425" /><anchor id="Pg425" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of the fair spinster's breast and moving arms:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And send their souls before him as he flies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now three times turn'd in prospect of the goal,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Assist, O goddess!" thus in thought he pray'd!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And present at his thought descends the maid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Buoy'd by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And feels a pinion lifting every limb.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(O'erturn'd by Pallas), where the slippery shore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Was clogg'd with slimy dung and mingled gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The self-same place beside Patroclus' pyre,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where late the slaughter'd victims fed the fire.)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Besmear'd with filth, and blotted o'er with clay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And left the urn Ulysses' rich reward.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The baffled hero thus the Greeks address'd:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A mortal I, a goddess was my foe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She urged her favourite on the rapid way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus sourly wail'd he, sputtering dirt and gore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A burst of laughter echoed through the shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antilochus, more humorous than the rest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Why with our wiser elders should we strive?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gods still love them, and they always thrive.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ye see, to Ajax I must yield the prize:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He to Ulysses, still more aged and wise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(A green old age unconscious of decays,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That proves the hero born in better days!)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold his vigour in this active race!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles only boasts a swifter pace:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For who can match Achilles? He who can,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Must yet be more than hero, more than man."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thy artful praise deserves a better prize.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Receive a talent of the purest gold."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youth departs content. The host admire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Nestor, worthy of his sire.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next these a buckler, spear, and helm, he brings;</l>
<pb n="426" /><anchor id="Pg426" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Cast on the plain, the brazen burden rings:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arms which of late divine Sarpedon wore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And great Patroclus in short triumph bore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Stand forth the bravest of our host! (he cries)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whoever dares deserve so rich a prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now grace the lists before our army's sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sheathed in steel, provoke his foe to fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who first the jointed armour shall explore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stain his rival's mail with issuing gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sword Asteropaeus possess'd of old,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(A Thracian blade, distinct with studs of gold,)</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">For each brave champion, when the combat ends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sumptuous banquet at our tents attends."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce at the word uprose great Tydeus' son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the huge bulk of Ajax Telamon.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Clad in refulgent steel, on either hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Louring they meet, tremendous to the sight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each Argive bosom beats with fierce delight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Opposed in arms not long they idly stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But thrice they closed, and thrice the charge renew'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A furious pass the spear of Ajax made</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the broad shield, but at the corslet stay'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not thus the foe: his javelin aim'd above</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The buckler's margin, at the neck he drove.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Greece, now trembling for her hero's life,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bade share the honours, and surcease the strife.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet still the victor's due Tydides gains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With him the sword and studded belt remains.</l>
</lg>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">A mass of iron (an enormous round),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose weight and size the circling Greeks admire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rude from the furnace, and but shaped by fire.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This mighty quoit Aetion wont to rear,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The giant by Achilles slain, he stow'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Among his spoils this memorable load.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For this, he bids those nervous artists vie,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Let him, whose might can hurl this bowl, arise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who farthest hurls it, take it as his prize;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Uprose great Ajax; up Epeus rose.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each stood in order: first Epeus threw;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High o'er the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Leonteus next a little space surpass'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And third, the strength of godlike Ajax cast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er both their marks it flew; till fiercely flung</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Polypoetes' arm the discus sung:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far as a swain his whirling sheephook throws,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That distant falls among the grazing cows,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">His friends, while loud applauses shake the skies,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those, who in skilful archery contend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He next invites the twanging bow to bend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And twice ten axes casts amidst the round,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mast, which late a first-rate galley bore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero fixes in the sandy shore;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: experienced Merion took the word;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their lots inscribed, and forth the latter flew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift from the string the sounding arrow flies;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">No firstling lambs, unheedful! didst thou vow</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">For this, thy well-aim'd arrow turn'd aside,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He takes the bow, directs the shaft above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And following with his eye the soaring dove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Implores the god to speed it through the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With vows of firstling lambs, and grateful sacrific</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dove, in airy circles as she wheels,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amid the clouds the piercing arrow feels;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Quite through and through the point its passage found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And at his feet fell bloody to the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wounded bird, ere yet she breathed her last,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With flagging wings alighted on the mast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A moment hung, and spread her pinions there,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then sudden dropp'd, and left her life in air.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To close the funeral games, Achilles last</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">With flowers high-wrought, not blacken'd yet by flame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For these he bids the heroes prove their art,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor here disdain'd the king of men to rise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With joy Pelides saw the honour paid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rose to the monarch, and respectful said:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thee first in virtue, as in power supreme,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">This beamy javelin in thy brother's war."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pleased from the hero's lips his praise to hear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king to Merion gives the brazen spear:</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR.</p>

<p>The gods deliberate about the redemption of Hector's body. Jupiter
sends Thetis to Achilles, to dispose him for the restoring it, and Iris
to Priam, to encourage him to go in person and treat for it. The old
king, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen, makes ready for
the journey, to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter. He sets
forth in his chariot, with a waggon loaded with presents, under the
charge of Idaeus the herald. Mercury descends in the shape of a young
man, and conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles. Their conversation
on the way. Priam finds Achilles at his table, casts himself at his
feet, and begs for the body of his son: Achilles, moved with
compassion, grants his request, detains him one night in his tent, and
the next morning sends him home with the body: the Trojans run out to
meet him. The lamentations of Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen, with the
solemnities of the funeral.</p>

<p>The time of twelve days is employed in this book, while the body of
Hector lies in the tent of Achilles; and as many more are spent in the
truce allowed for his interment. The scene is partly in Achilles' camp,
and partly in Troy.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now from the finish'd games the Grecian band</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seek their black ships, and clear the crowded strand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All stretch'd at ease the genial banquet share,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pleasing slumbers quiet all their care.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so Achilles: he, to grief resign'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His friend's dear image present to his mind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Takes his sad couch, more unobserved to weep;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor tastes the gifts of all-composing sleep.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Restless he roll'd around his weary bed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all his soul on his Patroclus fed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The form so pleasing, and the heart so kind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That youthful vigour, and that manly mind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What toils they shared, what martial works they wrought,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What seas they measured, and what fields they fought;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All pass'd before him in remembrance dear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thought follows thought, and tear succeeds to tear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now supine, now prone, the hero lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now shifts his side, impatient for the day:</l>
<pb n="430" /><anchor id="Pg430" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then starting up, disconsolate he goes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wide on the lonely beach to vent his woes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There as the solitary mourner raves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ruddy morning rises o'er the waves:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as it rose, his furious steeds he join'd!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chariot flies, and Hector trails behind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thrice, Patroclus! round thy monument</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Was Hector dragg'd, then hurried to the tent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There sleep at last o'ercomes the hero's eyes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While foul in dust the unhonour'd carcase lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But not deserted by the pitying skies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For Phoebus watch'd it with superior care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Preserved from gaping wounds and tainting air;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, ignominious as it swept the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spread o'er the sacred corse his golden shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All heaven was moved, and Hermes will'd to go</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By stealth to snatch him from the insulting foe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Neptune this, and Pallas this denies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And th' unrelenting empress of the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">E'er since that day implacable to Troy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What time young Paris, simple shepherd boy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Won by destructive lust (reward obscene),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their charms rejected for the Cyprian queen.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when the tenth celestial morning broke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To heaven assembled, thus Apollo spoke:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Unpitying powers! how oft each holy fane</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Has Hector tinged with blood of victims slain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And can ye still his cold remains pursue?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still grudge his body to the Trojans' view?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deny to consort, mother, son, and sire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The last sad honours of a funeral fire?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is then the dire Achilles all your care?</l>
<pb n="431" /><anchor id="Pg431" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That iron heart, inflexibly severe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A lion, not a man, who slaughters wide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In strength of rage, and impotence of pride;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who hastes to murder with a savage joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Invades around, and breathes but to destroy!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shame is not of his soul; nor understood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The greatest evil and the greatest good.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still for one loss he rages unresign'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Repugnant to the lot of all mankind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To lose a friend, a brother, or a son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaven dooms each mortal, and its will is done:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Awhile they sorrow, then dismiss their care;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fate gives the wound, and man is born to bear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But this insatiate, the commission given</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By fate exceeds, and tempts the wrath of heaven:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo, how his rage dishonest drags along</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector's dead earth, insensible of wrong!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Brave though he be, yet by no reason awed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He violates the laws of man and god."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"If equal honours by the partial skies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Are doom'd both heroes, (Juno thus replies,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If Thetis' son must no distinction know,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then hear, ye gods! the patron of the bow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Hector only boasts a mortal claim,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His birth deriving from a mortal dame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles, of your own ethereal race,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Springs from a goddess by a man's embrace</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(A goddess by ourself to Peleus given,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A man divine, and chosen friend of heaven)</l>
<pb n="432" /><anchor id="Pg432" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To grace those nuptials, from the bright abode</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yourselves were present; where this minstrel-god,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Well pleased to share the feast, amid the quire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stood proud to hymn, and tune his youthful lyre."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus the Thunderer checks the imperial dame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Let not thy wrath the court of heaven inflame;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their merits, nor their honours, are the same.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But mine, and every god's peculiar grace</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector deserves, of all the Trojan race:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still on our shrines his grateful offerings lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The only honours men to gods can pay,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor ever from our smoking altar ceased</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The pure libation, and the holy feast:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Howe'er by stealth to snatch the corse away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">We will not: Thetis guards it night and day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But haste, and summon to our courts above</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The azure queen; let her persuasion move</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her furious son from Priam to receive</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The proffer'd ransom, and the corse to leave."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He added not: and Iris from the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift as a whirlwind, on the message flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meteorous the face of ocean sweeps,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Refulgent gliding o'er the sable deeps.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Between where Samos wide his forests spreads,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rocky Imbrus lifts its pointed heads,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Down plunged the maid; (the parted waves resound;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She plunged and instant shot the dark profound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As bearing death in the fallacious bait,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the bent angle sinks the leaden weight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So pass'd the goddess through the closing wave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where Thetis sorrow'd in her secret cave:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There placed amidst her melancholy train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The blue-hair'd sisters of the sacred main)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pensive she sat, revolving fates to come,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wept her godlike son's approaching doom.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus the goddess of the painted bow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Arise, O Thetis! from thy seats below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis Jove that calls."—"And why (the dame replies)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Calls Jove his Thetis to the hated skies?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sad object as I am for heavenly sight!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah may my sorrows ever shun the light!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Howe'er, be heaven's almighty sire obey'd—"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She spake, and veil'd her head in sable shade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which, flowing long, her graceful person clad;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And forth she paced, majestically sad.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The deeps dividing, o'er the coast they rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And touch with momentary flight the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There in the lightning's blaze the sire they found,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all the gods in shining synod round.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thetis approach'd with anguish in her face,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Minerva rising, gave the mourner place,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even Juno sought her sorrows to console,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And offer'd from her hand the nectar-bowl:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She tasted, and resign'd it: then began</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sacred sire of gods and mortal man:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thou comest, fair Thetis, but with grief o'ercast;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Suffice, we know and we partake thy cares;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Twas voted, Hermes from his godlike foe</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"How long, unhappy! shall thy sorrows flow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thy heart waste with life-consuming woe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mindless of food, or love, whose pleasing reign</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soothes weary life, and softens human pain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O snatch the moments yet within thy power;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not long to live, indulge the amorous hour!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! Jove himself (for Jove's command I bear)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forbids to tempt the wrath of heaven too far.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No longer then (his fury if thou dread)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Detain the relics of great Hector dead;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then down her bow the winged Iris drives,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And swift at Priam's mournful court arrives:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where the sad sons beside their father's throne</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sat bathed in tears, and answer'd groan with groan.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all amidst them lay the hoary sire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Sad scene of woe!) his face his wrapp'd attire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Conceal'd from sight; with frantic hands he spread</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A shower of ashes o'er his neck and head.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From room to room his pensive daughters roam;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose shrieks and clamours fill the vaulted dome;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mindful of those, who late their pride and joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lie pale and breathless round the fields of Troy!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before the king Jove's messenger appears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus in whispers greets his trembling ears:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Fear not, O father! no ill news I bear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Jove I come, Jove makes thee still his care;</l>
<pb n="435" /><anchor id="Pg435" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For Hector's sake these walls he bids thee leave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bear what stern Achilles may receive;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alone, for so he wills; no Trojan near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Except, to place the dead with decent care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some aged herald, who with gentle hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">May the slow mules and funeral car command.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor shalt thou death, nor shall thou danger dread:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe through the foe by his protection led:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thee Hermes to Pelides shall convey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Guard of thy life, and partner of thy way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce as he is, Achilles' self shall spare</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy age, nor touch one venerable hair;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some thought there must be in a soul so brave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some sense of duty, some desire to save."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She spoke, and vanish'd. Priam bids prepare</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His gentle mules and harness to the car;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There, for the gifts, a polish'd casket lay:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His pious sons the king's command obey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then pass'd the monarch to his bridal-room,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where cedar-beams the lofty roofs perfume,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And where the treasures of his empire lay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then call'd his queen, and thus began to say:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Unhappy consort of a king distress'd!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Partake the troubles of thy husband's breast:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I saw descend the messenger of Jove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who bids me try Achilles' mind to move;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forsake these ramparts, and with gifts obtain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The corse of Hector, at yon navy slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tell me thy thought: my heart impels to go</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through hostile camps, and bears me to the foe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hoary monarch thus. Her piercing cries</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sad Hecuba renews, and then replies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ah! whither wanders thy distemper'd mind?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And where the prudence now that awed mankind?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through Phrygia once and foreign regions known;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now all confused, distracted, overthrown!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Singly to pass through hosts of foes! to face</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(O heart of steel!) the murderer of thy race!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To view that deathful eye, and wander o'er</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those hands yet red with Hector's noble gore!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alas! my lord! he knows not how to spare.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And what his mercy, thy slain sons declare;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So brave! so many fallen! To claim his rage</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain were thy dignity, and vain thy age.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No—pent in this sad palace, let us give</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To grief the wretched days we have to live.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still, still for Hector let our sorrows flow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Born to his own, and to his parents' woe!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Doom'd from the hour his luckless life begun,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To dogs, to vultures, and to Peleus' son!</l>
<pb n="436" /><anchor id="Pg436" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh! in his dearest blood might I allay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My rage, and these barbarities repay!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For ah! could Hector merit thus, whose breath</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Expired not meanly, in unactive death?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He poured his latest blood in manly fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fell a hero in his country's right."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Seek not to stay me, nor my soul affright</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With words of omen, like a bird of night,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Replied unmoved the venerable man;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis heaven commands me, and you urge in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had any mortal voice the injunction laid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor augur, priest, nor seer, had been obey'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A present goddess brought the high command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I saw, I heard her, and the word shall stand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I go, ye gods! obedient to your call:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If in yon camp your powers have doom'd my fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Content—By the same hand let me expire!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Add to the slaughter'd son the wretched sire!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One cold embrace at least may be allow'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And my last tears flow mingled with his blood!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From forth his open'd stores, this said, he drew</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Twelve costly carpets of refulgent hue,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As many vests, as many mantles told,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And twelve fair veils, and garments stiff with gold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two tripods next, and twice two chargers shine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With ten pure talents from the richest mine;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And last a large well-labour'd bowl had place,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The pledge of treaties once with friendly Thrace:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seem'd all too mean the stores he could employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For one last look to buy him back to Troy!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! the sad father, frantic with his pain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around him furious drives his menial train:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain each slave with duteous care attends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each office hurts him, and each face offends.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What make ye here, officious crowds! (he cries).</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hence! nor obtrude your anguish on my eyes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Have ye no griefs at home, to fix ye there:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Am I the only object of despair?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Am I become my people's common show,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Set up by Jove your spectacle of woe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No, you must feel him too; yourselves must fall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The same stern god to ruin gives you all:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor is great Hector lost by me alone;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your sole defence, your guardian power is gone!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I see your blood the fields of Phrygia drown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I see the ruins of your smoking town!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O send me, gods! ere that sad day shall come,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A willing ghost to Pluto's dreary dome!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and feebly drives his friends away:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sorrowing friends his frantic rage obey.</l>
<pb n="437" /><anchor id="Pg437" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next on his sons his erring fury falls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Polites, Paris, Agathon, he calls;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His threats Deiphobus and Dius hear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hippothous, Pammon, Helenes the seer,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And generous Antiphon: for yet these nine</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Survived, sad relics of his numerous line.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Inglorious sons of an unhappy sire!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Why did not all in Hector's cause expire?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wretch that I am! my bravest offspring slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">You, the disgrace of Priam's house, remain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mestor the brave, renown'd in ranks of war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With Troilus, dreadful on his rushing car,<note place="foot"><p>"Troilus is only once named in the Iliad; he was mentioned
also in the Cypriad but his youth, beauty, and untimely end made him an

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And last great Hector, more than man divine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For sure he seem'd not of terrestrial line!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All those relentless Mars untimely slew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And left me these, a soft and servile crew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose days the feast and wanton dance employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gluttons and flatterers, the contempt of Troy!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Why teach ye not my rapid wheels to run,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And speed my journey to redeem my son?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sons their father's wretched age revere,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forgive his anger, and produce the car.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on the seat the cabinet they bind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The new-made car with solid beauty shined;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Box was the yoke, emboss'd with costly pains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hung with ringlets to receive the reins;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nine cubits long, the traces swept the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These to the chariot's polish'd pole they bound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then fix'd a ring the running reins to guide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And close beneath the gather'd ends were tied.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next with the gifts (the price of Hector slain)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sad attendants load the groaning wain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Last to the yoke the well-matched mules they bring,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The gift of Mysia to the Trojan king.)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But the fair horses, long his darling care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Himself received, and harness'd to his car:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Grieved as he was, he not this task denied;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hoary herald help'd him, at his side.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While careful these the gentle coursers join'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sad Hecuba approach'd with anxious mind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A golden bowl that foam'd with fragrant wine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Libation destined to the power divine,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Held in her right, before the steed she stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus consigns it to the monarch's hands:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Take this, and pour to Jove; that safe from harms</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaven, or thy soul, inspires this bold design;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pray to that god, who high on Ida's brow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Surveys thy desolated realms below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His winged messenger to send from high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lead thy way with heavenly augury:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"'Tis just (said Priam) to the sire above</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To raise our hands; for who so good as Jove?"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and bade the attendant handmaid bring</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The purest water of the living spring:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Her ready hands the ewer and bason held:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then took the golden cup his queen had fill'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On the mid pavement pours the rosy wine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Uplifts his eyes, and calls the power divine:</l>
</lg>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O first and greatest! heaven's imperial lord!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On lofty Ida's holy hill adored!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To stern Achilles now direct my ways,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove heard his prayer, and from the throne on high,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">On his slow wheels the following people wait,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mourn at each step, and give him up to fate;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With hands uplifted eye him as he pass'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gaze upon him as they gazed their last.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now forward fares the father on his way,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the lone fields, and back to Ilion they.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Jove beheld him as he cross'd the plain,</l>

Coleridge are well worth reading:—</p>

<p>"By a close study of life, and by a true and natural mode of expressing
everything, Homer was enabled to venture upon the most peculiar and
difficult situations, and to extricate himself from them with the
completest success. The whole scene between Achilles and Priam, when
the latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose of redeeming the
body of Hector, is at once the most profoundly skilful, and yet the
simplest and most affecting passage in the Iliad. Quinctilian has taken
notice of the following speech of Priam, the rhetorical artifice of
which is so transcendent, that if genius did not often, especially in
oratory, unconsciously fulfil the most subtle precepts of criticism, we
might be induced, on this account alone, to consider the last book of
the Iliad as what is called spurious, in other words, of later date
than the rest of the poem. Observe the exquisite taste of Priam in
occupying the mind of Achilles, from the outset, with the image of his
father; in gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation;
and, lastly, mentioning Hector's name when he perceives that the hero
is softened, and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of
the conqueror. The ego d'eleeinoteros per, and the apusato aecha
geronta, are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the
Iliad. They are almost too fine and pathetic. The whole passage defies
translation, for there is that about the Greek which has no name, but
which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can only be felt in
the original, and is lost in an attempt to transfuse it into another
language."—Coleridge, p. 195.</p></note></l>

cannot but offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity. The
heroic age, however, must be judged by its own moral laws. Retributive
vengeance on the dead, as well as the living, was a duty inculcated
by the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that
evil inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured man;
but made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of
the body from which it had separated. Hence a denial of the rites
essential to the soul's admission into the more favoured regions of the
lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary shores
of the infernal river. The complaint of the ghost of Patroclus to
Achilles, of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies, shows how
efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must have
been in satiating the thirst of revenge, which, even after death, was
supposed to torment the dwellers in Hades. Hence before yielding up the
body of Hector to Priam, Achilles asks pardon of Patroclus for even
this partial cession of his just rights of retribution."—Mure, vol. i.

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ah, dearest friend! in whom the gods had join'd<note place="foot"><p>The following observations of Coleridge furnish a most
gallant and interesting view of Helen's character—</p>

<p>"Few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand that
has given us the fury and inconsistency of Achilles, gives us also the
consummate elegance and tenderness of Helen. She is through the Iliad a
genuine lady, graceful in motion and speech, noble in her associations,
full of remorse for a fault for which higher powers seem responsible,
yet grateful and affectionate towards those with whom that fault had
committed her. I have always thought the following speech in which
Helen laments Hector, and hints at her own invidious and unprotected
situation in Troy, as almost the sweetest passage in the poem. It is
another striking instance of that refinement of feeling and softness of
tone which so generally distinguish the last book of the Iliad from the
rest."—Classic Poets, p. 198, seq.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tne mildest manners with the bravest mind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now twice ten years (unhappy years) are o'er</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Since Paris brought me to the Trojan shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(O had I perish'd, ere that form divine</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seduced this soft, this easy heart of mine!)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet was it ne'er my fate, from thee to find</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A deed ungentle, or a word unkind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When others cursed the authoress of their woe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy pity check'd my sorrows in their flow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If some proud brother eyed me with disdain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or scornful sister with her sweeping train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy gentle accents soften'd all my pain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For thee I mourn, and mourn myself in thee,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wretched source of all this misery.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fate I caused, for ever I bemoan;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sad Helen has no friend, now thou art gone!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through Troy's wide streets abandon'd shall I roam!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In Troy deserted, as abhorr'd at home!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So spoke the fair, with sorrow-streaming eye.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Distressful beauty melts each stander-by.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On all around the infectious sorrow grows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Priam check'd the torrent as it rose:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Perform, ye Trojans! what the rites require,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fell the forests for a funeral pyre;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Twelve days, nor foes nor secret ambush dread;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles grants these honours to the dead."<note place="foot"><p>"And here we part with Achilles at the moment best
calculated to exalt and purify our impression of his character. We had
accompanied him through the effervescence, undulations, and final
subsidence of his stormy passions. We now leave him in repose and under
the full influence of the more amiable affections, while our admiration
of his great qualities is chastened by the reflection that, within a
few short days the mighty being in whom they were united was himself to
be suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise.</p>

<p>The frequent and touching allusions, interspersed throughout the Iliad,
to the speedy termination of its hero's course, and the moral on the
vanity of human life which they indicate, are among the finest
evidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the whole framework of
the poem is united."—Mure, vol. i. p 201.</p></note></l>

and the terrible effects of it, at an end, as that only was the subject
of the poem, and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our author
to proceed to the event of the war, it perhaps may be acceptable to the
common reader to give a short account of what happened to Troy and the
chief actors in this poem after the conclusion of it.</p>

<p>I need not mention that Troy was taken soon after the death of Hector
by the stratagem of the wooden horse, the particulars of which are
described by Virgil in the second book of the Æneid.</p>

<p>Achilles fell before Troy, by the hand of Paris, by the shot of an
arrow in his heel, as Hector had prophesied at his death, lib. xxii.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Priam was killed by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles.</p>

<p>Ajax, after the death of Achilles, had a contest with Ulysses for the
armour of Vulcan, but being defeated in his aim, he slew himself
through indignation.</p>

<p>Helen, after the death of Paris, married Deiphobus his brother, and at
the taking of Troy betrayed him, in order to reconcile herself to
Menelaus her first husband, who received her again into favour.</p>

<p>Agamemnon at his return was barbarously murdered by Ægysthus, at the
instigation of Clytemnestra his wife, who in his absence had
dishonoured his bed with Ægysthus.</p>

<p>Diomed, after the fall of Troy, was expelled his own country, and
scarce escaped with his life from his adulterous wife Ægiale; but at
last was received by Daunus in Apulia, and shared his kingdom; it is
uncertain how he died.</p>

<p>Nestor lived in peace with his children, in Pylos, his native country.</p>

<p>Ulysses also, after innumerable troubles by sea and land, at last
returned in safety to Ithaca, which is the subject of Homer's Odyssey.</p>

<p>For what remains, I beg to be excused from the ceremonies of taking
leave at the end of my work, and from embarrassing myself, or others,
with any defences or apologies about it. But instead of endeavouring to
raise a vain monument to myself, of the merits or difficulties of it
(which must be left to the world, to truth, and to posterity), let me
leave behind me a memorial of my friendship with one of the most
valuable of men, as well as finest writers, of my age and country, one
who has tried, and knows by his own experience, how hard an undertaking
it is to do justice to Homer, and one whom (I am sure) sincerely
rejoices with me at the period of my labours. To him, therefore, having
brought this long work to a conclusion, I desire to dedicate it, and to
have the honour and satisfaction of placing together, in this manner,
the names of Mr. CONGREVE, and of</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one — the old editions will be
renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one
owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and
you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission
and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth in the
General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to copying and
distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the Project
Gutenberg™ concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered
trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you
receive specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of
this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given away
— you may do practically _anything_ with public domain eBooks.
Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the

or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.


1.E.3.

      Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4,
      “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
      Archive Foundation.”

    - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™ License.
      You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the
      works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and
      all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™ works.

    - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the

Section 3 below.


1.F.


1.F.1.


Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to
identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain
works in creating the Project Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these
efforts, Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, and the medium on which they
may be stored, may contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to,
incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright
or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk
or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot
be read by your equipment.


1.F.2.


LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES — Except for the “Right of
Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg™
trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg™
electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for
damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE
NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH
OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE
FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGE.


1.F.3.


LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND — If you discover a defect in this
electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund
of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to
the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a
physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect
to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the
work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose
to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in
lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a
refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.


1.F.4.


Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in
paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ’AS-IS,’ WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.


1.F.5.


Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the
exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or
limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state
applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make
the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state
law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement
shall not void the remaining provisions.


1.F.6.


INDEMNITY — You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark
owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of
Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and
any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution

this or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any Defect
you cause.


Section  2.


           Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™


Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring
that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at
http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.


  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
                                Foundation


Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please

Section 5.


      General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance
with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook’s eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
(zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the
old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:


    http://www.gutenberg.org


This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how
to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,
how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email
newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
